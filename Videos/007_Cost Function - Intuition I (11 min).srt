00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,009
In the previous video, we gave the
mathematical definition of the cost

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:08,061
function. In this video, let's look at
some examples, to get back to intuition

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:14,046
about what the cost function is doing, and
why we want to use it. To recap, here's

4
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:19,039
what we had last time. We want to fit a
straight line to our data, so we had this

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,095
formed as a hypothesis with these
parameters theta zero and theta one, and

6
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:28,088
with different choices of the parameters
we end up with different straight line

7
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,075
fits. So the data which are fit
like so, and there's a cost function, and

8
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,055
that was our optimization objective.
[sound] So this video, in order to better

9
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:43,029
visualize the cost function J, I'm going
to work with a simplified hypothesis

10
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:48,021
function, like that shown on the right. So
I'm gonna use my simplified hypothesis,

11
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:53,027
which is just theta one times X. We can,
if you want, think of this as setting the

12
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:58,072
parameter theta zero equal to 0. So I
have only one parameter theta one and

13
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:04,037
my cost function is similar to before
except that now H of X that is now equal

14
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:10,030
to just theta one times X. And I have only
one parameter theta one and so my

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,024
optimization objective is to minimize j of
theta one. In pictures what this means is

16
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:21,061
that if theta zero equals zero that
corresponds to choosing only hypothesis

17
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:27,017
functions that pass through the origin,
that pass through the point (0, 0). Using

18
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:33,041
this simplified definition of a hypothesizing cost
function let's try to understand the cost

19
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:40,017
function concept better. It turns out that
two key functions we want to understand.

20
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:46,043
The first is the hypothesis function, and
the second is a cost function. So, notice

21
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:52,006
that the hypothesis, right, H of X. For a
face value of theta one, this is a

22
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:58,016
function of X. So the hypothesis is a
function of, what is the size of the house

23
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,095
X. In contrast, the cost function, J,
that's a function of the parameter, theta

24
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:09,099
one, which controls the slope of the
straight line. Let's plot these functions

25
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:15,048
and try to understand them both better.
Let's start with the hypothesis. On the left,

26
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:20,028
let's say here's my training set with
three points at (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3). Let's

27
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:25,033
pick a value theta one, so when theta one
equals one, and if that's my choice for

28
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:30,039
theta one, then my hypothesis is going to
look like this straight line over here.

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,023
And I'm gonna point out, when I'm plotting
my hypothesis function. X-axis, my

30
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:40,052
horizontal axis is labeled X, is labeled
you know, size of the house over here.

31
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:46,055
Now, of temporary, set
theta one equals one, what I want to do is

32
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:52,043
figure out what is j of theta one, when
theta one equals one. So let's go ahead

33
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:58,078
and compute what the cost function has
for. You'll devalue one. Well, as usual,

34
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:05,076
my cost function is defined as follows,
right? Some from, some of 'em are training

35
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:13,084
sets of this usual squared error term.
And, this is therefore equal to. And this.

36
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:25,006
Of theta one x I minus y I and if you
simplify this turns out to be. That. Zero

37
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:31,099
Squared to zero squared to zero squared which
is of course, just equal to zero. Now,

38
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:39,009
inside the cost function. It turns out each
of these terms here is equal to zero. Because

39
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:46,028
for the specific training set I have or my
3 training examples are (1, 1), (2, 2), (3,3). If theta

40
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:54,066
one is equal to one. Then h of x. H of x
i. Is equal to y I exactly, let me write

41
00:03:54,066 --> 00:04:04,016
this better. Right? And so, h of x minus
y, each of these terms is equal to zero,

42
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:14,082
which is why I find that j of one is equal
to zero. So, we now know that j of one Is

43
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:20,050
equal to zero. Let's plot that. What I'm
gonna do on the right is plot my cost

44
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,018
function j. And notice, because my cost
function is a function of my parameter

45
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:32,001
theta one, when I plot my cost function,
the horizontal axis is now labeled with

46
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:38,006
theta one. So I have j of one zero
zero so let's go ahead and plot that. End

47
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:46,046
up with. An X over there. Now lets look at
some other examples. Theta-1 can take on a

48
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:52,047
range of different values. Right? So
theta-1 can take on the negative values,

49
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:58,087
zero, positive values. So what if theta-1
is equal to 0.5. What happens then? Let's

50
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:05,044
go ahead and plot that. I'm now going to
set theta-1 equals 0.5, and in that case my

51
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:11,068
hypothesis now looks like this. As a line
with slope equals to 0.5, and, lets

52
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:17,085
compute J, of 0.5. So that is going to be
one over 2M of, my usual cost function.

53
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:23,076
It turns out that the cost function is
going to be the sum of square values of

54
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:29,060
the height of this line. Plus the sum of
square of the height of that line, plus

55
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,078
the sum of square of the height of that
line, right? ?Cause just this vertical

56
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:42,085
distance, that's the difference between,
you know, Y. I. and the predicted value, H

57
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:48,077
of XI, right? So the first example
is going to be 0.5 minus one squared.

58
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:55,064
Because my hypothesis predicted 0.5.
Whereas, the actual value was one. For my

59
00:05:55,064 --> 00:06:02,043
second example, I get, one minus two
squared, because my hypothesis predicted

60
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:09,066
one, but the actual housing price was two.
And then finally, plus. 1.5 minus three

61
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:17,026
squared. And so that's equal to one over
two times three. Because, M when trading

62
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:24,027
set size, right, have three training
examples. In that, that's times

63
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:33,001
simplifying for the parentheses it's 3.5.
So that's 3.5 over six which is about

64
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:41,008
0.68. So now we know that j of 0.5 is
about 0.68. Lets go and plot that. Oh

65
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:50,030
excuse me, math error, it's actually 0.58. So
we plot that which is maybe about over

66
00:06:50,030 --> 00:07:00,029
there. Okay? Now, let's do one more. How
about if theta one is equal to zero, what

67
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:08,097
is J of zero equal to? It turns out that
if theta one is equal to zero, then H of X

68
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:16,091
is just equal to, you know, this flat
line, right, that just goes horizontally

69
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:26,088
like this. And so, measuring the errors.
We have that J of zero is equal to one

70
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:34,065
over two M, times one squared plus two
squared plus three squared, which is, One

71
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:41,055
six times fourteen which is about 2.3. So
let's go ahead and plot as well. So it

72
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,062
ends up with a value around 2.3
and of course we can keep on doing this

73
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:53,033
for other values of theta one. It turns
out that you can have you know negative

74
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:59,032
values of theta one as well so if theta
one is negative then h of x would be equal

75
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:05,017
to say minus 0.5 times x then theta
one is minus 0.5 and so that corresponds

76
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:10,018
to a hypothesis with a
slope of negative 0.5. And you can

77
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:15,069
actually keep on computing these errors.
This turns out to be, you know, for 0.5,

78
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:21,051
it turns out to have really high error. It
works out to be something, like, 5.25. And

79
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:28,008
so on, and the different values of theta
one, you can compute these things, right?

80
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:34,041
And it turns out that you, your computed
range of values, you get something like

81
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:40,049
that. And by computing the range of
values, you can actually slowly create

82
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:50,099
out. What does function J of Theta say and
that's what J of Theta is. To recap, for

83
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:57,085
each value of theta one, right? Each value
of theta one corresponds to a different

84
00:08:57,085 --> 00:09:04,044
hypothesis, or to a different straight
line fit on the left. And for each value

85
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:11,072
of theta one, we could then derive a
different value of j of theta one. And for

86
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:19,035
example, you know, theta one=1,
corresponded to this straight line

87
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:27,084
straight through the data. Whereas theta
one=0.5. And this point shown in magenta

88
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:35,034
corresponded to maybe that line, and theta
one=zero which is shown in blue that corresponds to

89
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:41,052
this horizontal line. Right, so for each
value of theta one we wound up with a

90
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:48,051
different value of J of theta one and we
could then use this to trace out this plot

91
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:54,046
on the right. Now you remember, the
optimization objective for our learning

92
00:09:54,046 --> 00:10:01,096
algorithm is we want to choose the value
of theta one. That minimizes J of theta one.

93
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:08,007
Right? This was our objective function for
the linear regression. Well, looking at

94
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:13,071
this curve, the value that minimizes j of
theta one is, you know, theta one equals

95
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:19,013
to one. And low and behold, that is indeed
the best possible straight line fit

96
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:24,062
through our data, by setting theta one
equals one. And just, for this particular

97
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:30,032
training set, we actually end up fitting
it perfectly. And that's why minimizing j

98
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:36,044
of theta one corresponds to finding a
straight line that fits the data well. So,

99
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:40,088
to wrap up. In this video, we looked up
some plots. To understand the cost

100
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:45,025
function. To do so, we simplify the
algorithm. So that it only had one

101
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:50,025
parameter theta one. And we set the
parameter theta zero to be only zero. In the next video.

102
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:54,044
We'll go back to the original problem
formulation and look at some

103
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:59,057
visualizations involving both theta zero
and theta one. That is without setting theta

104
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:04,075
zero to zero. And hopefully that will give
you, an even better sense of what the cost

105
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:09,025
function j is doing in the original
linear regression formulation.
