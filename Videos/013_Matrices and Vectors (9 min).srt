1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,085
Let's get started with our linear algebra review.

2
00:00:02,087 --> 00:00:03,085
In this video I want to

3
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:06,020
tell you what are matrices and what are vectors.

4
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:10,076
A matrix is a

5
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,058
rectangular array of numbers

6
00:00:13,057 --> 00:00:14,081
written between square brackets.

7
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:17,025
So, for example, here is a

8
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:20,017
matrix on the right, a left square bracket.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,066
And then, write in a bunch of numbers.

10
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,010
These could be features from

11
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,066
a learning problem or it could

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,074
be data from somewhere else, but

13
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:36,089
the specific values don't matter,

14
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:40,046
and then I'm going to close it with another right bracket on the right.

15
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:41,043
And so that's one matrix.

16
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:43,052
And, here's another example of

17
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:46,035
the matrix, let's write 3, 4, 5,6.

18
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:48,002
So matrix is just another

19
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:49,063
way for saying, is a

20
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:51,053
2D or a two dimensional array.

21
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:54,092
And the other piece

22
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,032
of knowledge that we need is

23
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,074
that the dimension of the

24
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:58,097
matrix is going to

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,007
be written as the

26
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:04,075
number of row times the number of columns in the matrix.

27
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,018
So, concretely, this example

28
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:09,070
on the left, this

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,000
has 1, 2, 3, 4

30
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,037
rows and has 2 columns,

31
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:15,095
and so this example on the

32
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,084
left is a 4 by

33
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:23,031
2 matrix -  number of rows by number of columns.

34
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:24,037
So, four rows, two columns.

35
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:27,073
This one on the right, this matrix has two rows.

36
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:29,079
That's the first row, that's

37
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,057
the second row, and it has three columns.

38
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:36,089
That's the first column, that's the

39
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,034
second column, that's the third

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,034
column So, this second

41
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,079
matrix we say it is

42
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:44,065
a 2 by 3 matrix.

43
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,023
So we say that the dimension of this matrix is 2 by 3.

44
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:51,068
Sometimes you also see this

45
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,048
written out, in the case

46
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:54,051
of left, you will see this

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,035
written out as R4 by 2

48
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:58,009
or concretely what people

49
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:00,028
will sometimes say this matrix

50
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:02,084
is an element of the set R 4 by 2.

51
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,026
So, this thing here, this

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,018
just means the set of all

53
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,001
matrices that of dimension

54
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,096
4 by 2 and this thing

55
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,065
on the right, sometimes this is

56
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,080
written out as a matrix that is an R 2 by 3.

57
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:16,008
So if you ever see, 2 by 3.

58
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:17,046
So if you ever see

59
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:18,069
something like this are 4 by

60
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:19,096
2 or are 2 by 3,

61
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:21,044
people are just referring to

62
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,083
matrices of a specific dimension.

63
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,024
Next, let's talk about how

64
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:31,037
to refer to specific elements of the matrix.

65
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,084
And by matrix elements, other than

66
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,009
the matrix I just mean

67
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:35,093
the entries, so the numbers inside the matrix.

68
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,027
So, in the standard notation,

69
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:40,011
if A is this

70
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,086
matrix here, then A sub-strip

71
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,005
IJ is going to refer

72
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,006
to the i, j entry,

73
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:48,049
meaning the entry in

74
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:50,068
the matrix in the ith row and jth column.

75
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,019
So for example a1-1 is

76
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:55,065
going to refer to the entry

77
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:57,050
in the 1st row and

78
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,090
the 1st column, so that's the

79
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,071
first row and the first

80
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:02,059
column and so a1-1

81
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:03,091
is going to be equal to

82
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:05,087
1, 4, 0, 2.

83
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,062
Another example, 8 1

84
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:10,002
2 is going to refer to

85
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:11,015
the entry in the first

86
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,086
row and the second

87
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,016
column and so A

88
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:19,000
1 2 is going to be equal to one nine one.

89
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:21,018
This come from a quick examples.

90
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:24,036
Let's see, A, oh let's

91
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:26,096
say A 3 2, is going to refer

92
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,024
to the entry in the 3rd

93
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:32,034
row, and second column,

94
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,003
right, because that's 3 2

95
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:41,027
so that's equal to 1 4 3 7.

96
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,047
And finally, 8 4 1

97
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:44,053
is going to refer to

98
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:47,031
this one right, fourth row,

99
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,021
first column is equal to

100
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:53,015
1 4 7 and if,

101
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:54,059
hopefully you won't, but if

102
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,056
you were to write and say

103
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:57,053
well this A 4

104
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,019
3, well, that refers to

105
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,012
the fourth row, and the

106
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,072
third column that, you know,

107
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:03,093
this matrix has no third

108
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:05,041
column so this is undefined,

109
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:08,028
you know, or you can think of this as an error.

110
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,071
There's no such element as

111
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,053
8 4 3, so, you know, you

112
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:14,050
shouldn't be referring to 8 4 3.

113
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:17,012
So, the matrix

114
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:19,006
gets you a way of letting

115
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:22,027
you quickly organize, index and access lots of data.

116
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,019
In case I seem to be

117
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,013
tossing up a lot of

118
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,011
concepts, a lot of new notations

119
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,092
very rapidly, you don't need

120
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:29,023
to memorize all of this, but

121
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,050
on the course website where we

122
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,033
have posted the lecture notes,

123
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,095
we also have all of these definitions written down.

124
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:37,074
So you can always refer back,

125
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,019
you know, either to these slides,

126
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:40,094
possible coursework, so audible lecture

127
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:44,006
notes if you forget well, A41 was that?

128
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,031
Which row, which column was that?

129
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:47,016
Don't worry about memorizing everything now.

130
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:48,095
You can always refer back to

131
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,058
the written materials on the course website, and use that as a reference.

132
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,074
So that's what a matrix is.

133
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:57,000
Next, let's talk about what is a vector.

134
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,039
A vector turns out to be a special case of a matrix.

135
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,017
A vector is a matrix

136
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,058
that has only 1 column so

137
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:04,064
you have an N x 1

138
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:07,032
matrix, then that's a remember, right?

139
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,097
N is the number of

140
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,075
rows, and 1 here

141
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,054
is the number of columns, so, so

142
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,075
matrix with just one column

143
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:15,073
is what we call a vector.

144
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:17,094
So here's an example

145
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,080
of a vector, with I

146
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,069
guess I have N equals four elements here.

147
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:25,008
so we also call this

148
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,056
thing, another term for

149
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,030
this is a four dmensional

150
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:31,041
vector, just means that

151
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:34,041
this is a vector with four

152
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,039
elements, with four numbers in it.

153
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,012
And, just as earlier

154
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,051
for matrices you saw this

155
00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:40,095
notation R3 by 2

156
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:42,033
to refer to 2 by

157
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,076
3 matrices, for this vector

158
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,033
we are going to refer to this

159
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,026
as a vector in the set R4.

160
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:50,089
So this R4 means a

161
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:53,048
set of four-dimensional vectors.

162
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,023
Next let's talk about how to refer to the elements of the vector.

163
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,097
We are going to use the notation

164
00:06:03,073 --> 00:06:06,002
yi to refer to

165
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,062
the ith element of the

166
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,064
vector y. So if y

167
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:11,047
is this vector, y subscript i is the ith element.

168
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,007
So y1 is the

169
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:16,031
first element,four sixty, y2

170
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:18,067
is equal to the second element,

171
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:21,002
two thirty two -there's the first.

172
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:21,077
There's the second.

173
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:24,083
Y3 is equal to

174
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,037
315 and so on, and

175
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,024
only y1 through y4 are

176
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:31,060
defined consistency 4-dimensional vector.

177
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,099
Also it turns out that

178
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:35,094
there are actually 2 conventions

179
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,058
for how to index into a

180
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:39,025
vector and here they are.

181
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:41,001
Sometimes, people will use

182
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,081
one index and sometimes zero index factors.

183
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,062
So this example on the left

184
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:47,098
is a one in that

185
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:49,024
specter where the element

186
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:51,087
we write is y1, y2, y3, y4.

187
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:54,070
And this example in the right

188
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:56,033
is an example of a zero index

189
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,037
factor where we start

190
00:06:58,073 --> 00:07:00,045
the indexing of the elements from zero.

191
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:04,062
So the elements go from a zero up to y three.

192
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:07,017
And this is a bit like the

193
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:08,077
arrays of some primary languages

194
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:11,007
where the arrays can either

195
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,074
be indexed starting from one.

196
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,038
The first element of an

197
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,058
array is sometimes a Y1,

198
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,048
this is sequence notation I guess,

199
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:20,057
and sometimes it's zero index

200
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,086
depending on what programming language you use.

201
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,000
So it turns out that in

202
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:26,068
most of math, the one

203
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,038
index version is more

204
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,014
common For a lot

205
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:32,063
of machine learning applications, zero index

206
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,039
vectors gives us a more convenient notation.

207
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,064
So what you should usually

208
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,057
do is, unless otherwised specified,

209
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:43,006
you should assume we are using one index vectors.

210
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:44,075
In fact, throughout the rest

211
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,037
of these videos on linear algebra

212
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:49,018
review, I will be using one index vectors.

213
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,017
But just be aware that

214
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,014
when we are talking about machine learning

215
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,098
applications, sometimes I will

216
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:55,033
explicitly say when we

217
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,063
need to switch to, when we

218
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,075
need to use the zero index

219
00:07:59,001 --> 00:07:59,027
vectors as well.

220
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:02,047
Finally, by convention, usually

221
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:04,047
when writing matrices and vectors,

222
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,070
most people will use upper

223
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,044
case to refer to matrices.

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,075
So we're going to use

225
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:12,002
capital letters like

226
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,083
A, B, C, you know,

227
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,037
X, to refer to matrices,

228
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,091
and usually we'll use lowercase,

229
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,062
like a, b, x, y,

230
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:22,045
to refer to either numbers,

231
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,039
or just raw numbers or scalars or to vectors.

232
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:27,086
This isn't always true but

233
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:29,020
this is the more common

234
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:30,061
notation where we use

235
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,087
lower case "Y" for referring

236
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,036
to vector and we usually

237
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,046
use upper case to refer to a matrix.

238
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,082
So, you now know what are matrices and vectors.

239
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,030
Next, we'll talk about some

240
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,033
of the things you can do with them
