00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,016
In this video, I want to just quickly step you
through the logistics of how to work on

2
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:09,038
homeworks in this class and how to use the
submission system which will let you verify

3
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:15,061
right away that you got the right answer for
your machine learning program exercise.

4
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:19,035
Here's my Octave window and
let's first go to my desktop.

5
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:25,037
I saved the files for my first exercise,
some of the files on my desktop:

6
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:27,099
in this directory, 'ml-class-ex1'.

7
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:32,092
And we provide a number files
and ask you to edit some of them.

8
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:40,070
So the first file should meet the details in
the pdf file for this programming exercise.

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,035
But one of the files we ask you to edit is
this file called warmUpExercise.m, where the

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:49,089
exercise is really just to make sure that
you're familiar with the submission system.

11
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,079
And all you need to do is
return the 5x5 identity matrix.

12
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,030
So the solution to this exercise I just
showed you is to write A = eye(5).

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,076
So that modifies this function to
generate the 5x5 identity matrix.

14
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:11,014
And this function warmUpExercise()
now returns the 5x5 identity matrix.

15
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:13,072
And I'm just going to save it.

16
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:17,046
So I've done the first part of this homework.
Going back to my Octave window,

17
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:27,018
let's now go to my directory,
'C:\Users\ang\Desktop\ml-class-ex1'.

18
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:33,034
And if I want to make sure that I've implemented
this, type 'warmUpExercise()' like so.

19
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:39,067
And yup, it returns the 5x5 identity matrix
that we just wrote the code to create.

20
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:43,087
And I can now submit the code as follows.
I'm going to type 'submit()' in this

21
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:49,029
directory and I'm ready to submit part 1
so I'm going to enter choice '1'.

22
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:54,038
So it asks me for my email address.
I'm going go to the course website.

23
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:59,068
This is an internal testing site, so your version
of the website may look a little bit different.

24
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:07,093
But that's my email address and this is my submission
password, and I'm just going to type them in here.

25
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:19,020
So I have ang@cs.stanford.edu and
my submission password is 9yC75USsGf.

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,084
I'm going to hit enter; it connects to the server
and submits it, and right away

27
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:28,056
it tells you "Congratulations! You have
successfully completed Homework 1 Part 1".

28
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:33,015
And this gives you a verification
that you got this part right.

29
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:36,079
And if you don't submit the right answer,
then it will give you a message indicating

30
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,050
that you haven't quite gotten it right yet.

31
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:47,086
And you can use this submission password and
you can generate new passwords; it doesn't matter.

32
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:52,055
But you can also use your regular website
login password, but because this password

33
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:59,028
here is typed in clear text on your monitor,
we gave you this extra submission password

34
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:03,065
in case you don't want to type in your
website's normal password onto a window

35
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:09,021
that, depending on your operating system,
may or may not appear as text when you type

36
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:14,054
it into the Octave submission script.

37
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:18,074
So, that's how you submit the
homeworks after you've done it.

38
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:23,069
Good luck, and, when you get around to
homeworks, I hope you get all of them right.

39
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,032
And finally, in the next and final Octave
tutorial video, I want to tell you about

40
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:33,033
vectorization, which is a way to get your
Octave code to run much more efficiently.
