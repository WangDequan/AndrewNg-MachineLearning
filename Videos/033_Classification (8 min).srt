1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:01,040
In this and the next

2
00:00:01,058 --> 00:00:02,073
few videos, I want to

3
00:00:02,096 --> 00:00:04,066
start to talk about classification problems,

4
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:07,000
where the variable y that

5
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,016
you want to predict is discreet

6
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:10,018
valued. We'll develop an

7
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,085
algorithm called logistic regression,

8
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,061
which is one of the

9
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:16,055
most popular and most widely used learning algorithms today.

10
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:22,014
Here are some examples of classification problems.

11
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:24,071
Earlier, we talked about emails,

12
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,069
spam classification as an

13
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,026
example of a classification problem.

14
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:32,015
Another example would be classifying online transactions.

15
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:34,010
So, if you have a website

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,053
that sells stuff and if you

17
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:36,074
want to know if a physical

18
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,014
transaction is fraudulent or

19
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:40,092
not, whether someone has, you

20
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:42,025
know, is using a stolen credit card

21
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:43,089
or has stolen the user's password.

22
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,082
That's another classification problem, and

23
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,021
earlier we also talked about

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,060
the example of classifying tumors

25
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:53,067
as a cancerous malignant or as benign tumors.

26
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,000
In all of these problems,

27
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:57,060
the variable that we're trying

28
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:58,086
to predict is a variable

29
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:00,010
Y that we can think

30
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,071
of as taking on two values,

31
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,012
either zero or one, either

32
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,078
a spam or not spam, fraudulent

33
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:08,073
or not fraudulent, malignant or benign.

34
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:11,043
Another name for the class

35
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:13,015
that we denote with 0 is

36
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,065
the negative class, and another

37
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:16,092
name for the class that we

38
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,034
denote with 1 is the positive class.

39
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,050
So 0 may denote the

40
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:23,045
benign tumor and 1

41
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,093
positive class may denote a malignant tumor.

42
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,040
The assignment of the 2

43
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,093
classes, you know, spam,

44
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,014
no spam, and so on -

45
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:32,046
the assignment of the 2

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,014
classes to positive and negative,

47
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,095
to 0 and 1 is somewhat

48
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:37,084
arbitrary and it doesn't really matter.

49
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:39,081
But often there is this

50
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,096
intuition that the negative

51
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:43,043
class is conveying the

52
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,068
absence of something, like the absence

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,043
of a malignant tumor, whereas one,

54
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:49,040
the positive class, is conveying

55
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:52,010
the presence of something that we may be looking for.

56
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,034
But the definition of which

57
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:55,040
is negative and which is positive

58
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:58,048
is somewhat arbitrary and it doesn't matter that much.

59
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:00,098
For now, we're going to start

60
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,003
with classification problems with just

61
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:04,054
two classes; zero and one.

62
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:07,001
Later on, we'll talk about multi-class

63
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,031
problems as well, whether variable

64
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:10,096
Y may take on say,

65
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:13,012
for value zero, one, two and three.

66
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:16,081
This is called a multi-class classification problem,

67
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:18,080
but for the next few

68
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:20,028
videos, let's start with the

69
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:22,075
two class or the binary classification problem.

70
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,065
and we'll worry about the multi-class setting later.

71
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:29,043
So, how do we develop a classification algorithm?

72
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:31,066
Here's an example of a

73
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:32,072
training set for a classification

74
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,080
task for classifying a tumor

75
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:37,053
as malignant or benign and

76
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,025
notice that malignancy takes on

77
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:41,019
only two values zero or

78
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,021
no or one or one or yes.

79
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,065
So, one thing we could

80
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:46,096
do given this training set

81
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,069
is to apply the algorithm

82
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:52,071
that we already know, linear regression to this data set

83
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,031
and just try to fit the straight line to the data.

84
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:57,047
So, if you take this training

85
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,075
set and fill a straight

86
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,031
line to it, maybe you get

87
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,053
hypothesis that looks like that.

88
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,091
Alright, so that's my hypothesis, h of

89
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,088
x equals theta transpose

90
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:09,033
x.
If you want

91
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,027
to make predictions, one thing

92
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,097
you could try doing is then

93
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,075
threshold the classifier outputs at 0.5.

94
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:19,087
That is at the vertical access value 0.5.

95
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,093
And if the hypothesis outputs

96
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,049
a value that's greater than

97
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:27,050
equal to 0.5 you predict y equals one.

98
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:29,093
If it's less than 0.5, you predict y equals zero.

99
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:32,053
Let's see what happens when we do that.

100
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:33,090
So, let's take 0.5, and

101
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,066
so, you know, that's where the threshold is.

102
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:39,025
And thus, using linear regression this way.

103
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:41,006
Everything to the right

104
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,046
of this point, we will end

105
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:43,068
up predicting as the positive

106
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:45,038
class because of the output

107
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,080
values are greater than 0.5

108
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,068
on the vertical axis and

109
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,072
everything to the left

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,025
of that point we will end

111
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,016
up predicting as a negative value.

112
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:57,056
In this particular example, it

113
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,040
looks like linear regression is actually

114
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:01,087
doing something reasonable even though

115
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,090
this is a classification task we're

116
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,043
interested in.

117
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,041
But now let's try changing problem a bit.

118
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,036
Let me extend out the horizontal

119
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:11,046
axis of orbit and let's

120
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:12,063
say we got one more training

121
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,003
example way out there on the right.

122
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:17,082
Notice that that additional training

123
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:19,019
example, this one out

124
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:21,070
here, it doesn't actually change anything, right?

125
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,047
Looking at the training set, it

126
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:26,033
is pretty clear what a good hypothesis is.

127
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:27,092
Well, everything to the right of

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,005
somewhere around here to the

129
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,097
right of this we should predict

130
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,027
as positive, and everything to

131
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:32,068
the left we should probably predict

132
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,069
as negative because from this

133
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,093
training set it looks like

134
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,087
all the tumors larger than, you

135
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:39,018
know, a certain value around here

136
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:41,002
are malignant, and all the

137
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,011
tumors smaller than that are

138
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,066
not malignant, at least for this training set.

139
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:47,027
But once we've added

140
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:49,006
that extra example out here,

141
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:50,066
if you now run linear regression,

142
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,058
you instead get a straight line fit to the data.

143
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,062
That might maybe look like this, and

144
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,086
if you now threshold this hypothesis

145
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:03,045
at 0.5, you end up with

146
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,055
a threshold that's around here

147
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,031
so that everything to the right

148
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,079
of this point you predict as

149
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:11,050
positive, and everything to the left of that point you predict as negative.

150
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:15,072
And this seems a pretty

151
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,050
bad thing for linear regression to have done, right?

152
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,083
Because, you know, these are

153
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:22,000
our positive examples, these are our negative examples.

154
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:24,057
It's pretty clear, we should

155
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
really be separating the two classes

156
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:28,018
somewhere around there, but somehow

157
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,002
by adding one example way

158
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:31,027
out here to the right, this

159
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,033
example really isn't giving us any new information.

160
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,094
I mean, it should be no

161
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,030
surprise to the learning out of

162
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,010
that the example way out here turns out to be malignant.

163
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:41,020
But somehow adding that example

164
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,042
out there caused linear regression

165
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,067
to change in straight line fit

166
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:47,064
to the data from this

167
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,000
magenta line out here

168
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,093
to this blue line over here,

169
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,076
and caused it to give us a worse hypothesis.

170
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:58,043
So, applying linear regression

171
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:01,002
to a classification problem usually

172
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,039
isn't, often isn't a great idea.

173
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:05,075
In the first instance, in the

174
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,008
first example before I added

175
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,077
this extra training example,

176
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,043
previously linear regression was

177
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:13,019
just getting lucky and it

178
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,099
got us a hypothesis that, you

179
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,029
know, worked well for that particular

180
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:19,047
example, but usually apply

181
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:20,097
linear regression to a data set,

182
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,004
you know, you might get lucky but

183
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:24,012
often it isn't a good

184
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,073
idea, so I wouldn't use

185
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,095
linear regression for classification problems.

186
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,081
Here is one other funny thing

187
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,064
about what would happen if

188
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:35,050
we were to use linear regression for a classification problem.

189
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:38,022
For classification, we know that

190
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,079
Y is either zero or one,

191
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,062
but if you are using

192
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:43,005
linear regression, well the hypothesis

193
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,075
can output values much larger

194
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,032
than one or less than

195
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,081
zero, even if all

196
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:50,068
of good the training examples have labels

197
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:52,041
Y equals zero or one,

198
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,087
and it seems kind of strange

199
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:56,075
that even though we

200
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:58,016
know that the label should

201
00:06:58,035 --> 00:06:59,031
be zero one, it seems

202
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:00,088
kind of strange if the

203
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,057
algorithm can offer values much

204
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,089
larger than one or much smaller than zero.

205
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,089
So what we'll do in the

206
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,039
next few videos is develop

207
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:14,063
an algorithm called logistic regression

208
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:17,038
which has the property that the

209
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,029
output, the predictions of logistic

210
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:21,022
regression are always between zero

211
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:22,075
and one, and doesn't become

212
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,017
bigger than one or become less

213
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,037
than zero and by

214
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,056
the way, logistic regression is

215
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,014
and we will use it as

216
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,076
a classification algorithm in some,

217
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:35,006
maybe sometimes confusing that

218
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,041
the term regression appears in

219
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:39,036
his name, even though logistic regression

220
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,027
is actually a classification algorithm.

221
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,004
But that's just the name it

222
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:46,013
was given for historical reasons so don't be confused by that.

223
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,033
Logistic Regression is actually a

224
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:50,025
classification algorithm that we

225
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,002
apply to settings where the

226
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:54,077
label Y is discreet valued. The 1001.

227
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,043
So hopefully you now

228
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,018
know why if you

229
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:00,094
have a causation problem using

230
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,066
linear regression isn't a good idea .

231
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,048
In the next video we'll

232
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,068
start working out the details

233
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,063
of the logistic regression algorithm.
