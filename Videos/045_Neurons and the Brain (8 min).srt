1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:01,072
Neural Networks are a pretty old

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:03,095
algorithm that was originally motivated

3
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:07,033
by the goal of having machines that can mimic the brain.

4
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:09,033
Now in this class, of course

5
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm teaching Neural Networks to you

6
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:12,016
because they work really well

7
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,007
for different machine learning problems and

8
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,091
not, certainly not because they're logically motivated.

9
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:19,026
In this video, I'd like

10
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:21,064
to give you some of the background on Neural Networks.

11
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:25,042
So that we can get a sense of what we can expect them to do.

12
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,017
Both in the sense of

13
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:28,032
applying them to modern day

14
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,046
machinery problems, as well as for

15
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,000
those of you that might

16
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:33,086
be interested in maybe the

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,013
big AI dream of someday

18
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,067
building truly intelligent machines.

19
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,064
Also, how Neural Networks might pertain to that.

20
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,025
The origins of Neural Networks was

21
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:46,032
as algorithms that try

22
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,088
to mimic the brain and

23
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,002
those a sense that if we

24
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:50,075
want to build learning systems

25
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,010
while why not mimic perhaps the

26
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:54,096
most amazing learning machine we

27
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,007
know about, which is perhaps the

28
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:58,071
brain. Neural Networks came to

29
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:00,071
be very widely used throughout the

30
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:03,025
1980's and 1990's and

31
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:04,084
for various reasons as popularity

32
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,068
diminished in the late

33
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:08,040
90's. But more recently,

34
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:10,051
Neural Networks  have had a

35
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:12,006
major recent resurgence.

36
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:14,053
One of the reasons for this

37
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:16,064
resurgence is that Neural Networks

38
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:19,001
are computationally some what

39
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,059
more expensive algorithm and

40
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:22,010
so, it was only, you know,

41
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:23,082
maybe somewhat more recently that

42
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,018
computers became fast enough

43
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,054
to really run large scale

44
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,060
Neural Networks and because of

45
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:30,095
that as well as a

46
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:32,093
few other technical reasons which we'll

47
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:34,084
talk about later, modern Neural

48
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,039
Networks today are the state

49
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,062
of the art technique for many applications.

50
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:41,000
So, when you think about mimicking

51
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:42,059
the brain while one of

52
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:44,085
the human brain does tell me same things, right?

53
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,065
The brain can learn to

54
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,017
see process images than to

55
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,032
hear, learn to process our sense of touch.

56
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:51,035
We can, you know, learn to

57
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,037
do math, learn to do

58
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,096
calculus, and the brain

59
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,056
does so many different and amazing things.

60
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:56,073
It seems like if you want

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,028
to mimic the brain it seems

62
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,062
like you have to write lots of different

63
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:01,034
pieces of software to mimic all

64
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:03,054
of these different fascinating, amazing things

65
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,057
that the brain tell us, but does

66
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,078
is this fascinating hypothesis that the

67
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,009
way the brain does all of

68
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,040
these different things is not

69
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:12,008
worth like a thousand different programs,

70
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,081
but instead, the way the

71
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,002
brain does it is worth

72
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:18,088
just a single learning algorithm.

73
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:20,084
This is just a hypothesis but

74
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,024
let me share with you

75
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:24,043
some of the evidence for this.

76
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:25,084
This part of the brain, that little

77
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,027
red part of the brain, is

78
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:29,015
your auditory cortex and

79
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,062
the way you're understanding my voice

80
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:33,034
now is your ear is

81
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,093
taking the sound signal and routing

82
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,093
the sound signal to your auditory

83
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:38,018
cortex and that's what's

84
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:40,009
allowing you to understand my words.

85
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,059
Neuroscientists have done the

86
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,056
following fascinating experiments where

87
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:46,030
you cut the wire from

88
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,043
the ears to the auditory

89
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:49,009
cortex and you re-wire,

90
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,000
in this case an animal's brain, so

91
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,031
that the signal from the eyes

92
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:56,088
to the optic nerve eventually gets routed to the auditory cortex.

93
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,013
If you do this it turns out,

94
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:00,062
the auditory cortex will learn

95
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:02,040
to see.

96
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:04,000
And this is in every single sense

97
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:06,027
of the word see as we know it.

98
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:07,046
So, if you do this to the animals,

99
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,078
the animals can perform visual discrimination

100
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:12,025
task and as they can

101
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:13,056
look at images and make appropriate

102
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,018
decisions based on the

103
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,046
images and they're doing

104
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:18,030
it with that piece of brain tissue.

105
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:20,015
Here's another example.

106
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:23,043
That red piece of brain tissue is your somatosensory cortex.

107
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:26,068
That's how you process your sense of touch.

108
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:29,002
If you do a similar re-wiring process

109
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:32,074
then the somatosensory cortex will learn to see.

110
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,071
Because of this and other

111
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,066
similar experiments, these are

112
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:38,019
called neuro-rewiring experiments.

113
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:40,055
There's this sense that if

114
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,066
the same piece of physical

115
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:44,002
brain tissue can process sight

116
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,096
or sound or touch then

117
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,047
maybe there is one learning

118
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,087
algorithm that can process

119
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,052
sight or sound or touch.

120
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:52,065
And instead of needing to

121
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:54,053
implement a thousand different programs

122
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:56,052
or a thousand different algorithms to

123
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,043
do, you know, the thousand wonderful things

124
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:00,050
that the brain does, maybe what

125
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,097
we need to do is figure out

126
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:04,090
some approximation or to whatever

127
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,021
the brain's learning algorithm is and

128
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:08,046
implement that and that the

129
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:10,012
brain learned by itself how to

130
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,086
process these different types of data.

131
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,018
To a surprisingly large extent,

132
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:15,072
it seems as if we can

133
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:17,043
plug in almost any sensor

134
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:19,001
to almost any part of

135
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,002
the brain and so, within the

136
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,099
reason, the brain will learn to deal with it.

137
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:26,047
Here are a few more examples.

138
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,068
On the upper left is

139
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,022
an example of learning to see with your tongue.

140
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,062
The way it works is--this is

141
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:35,069
actually a system called BrainPort undergoing

142
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,069
FDA trials now to help

143
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:39,037
blind people see--but the

144
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:41,030
way it works is, you strap

145
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,036
a grayscale camera to your

146
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:45,031
forehead, facing forward, that takes

147
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:47,068
the low resolution grayscale image

148
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,023
of what's in front of you

149
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:50,062
and you then run a wire

150
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:52,070
to an array of electrodes

151
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,054
that you place on your tongue

152
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:56,037
so that each pixel gets mapped

153
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:58,072
to a location on your

154
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,030
tongue where maybe a

155
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,085
high voltage corresponds to a

156
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,062
dark pixel and a low voltage

157
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,077
corresponds to a bright

158
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,031
pixel and, even as

159
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,057
it does today, with this sort

160
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:10,083
of system you and I will

161
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,024
be able to learn to see, you know,

162
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:15,012
in tens of minutes with our tongues.

163
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:16,079
Here's a second example of human

164
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,060
echo location or human sonar.

165
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,099
So there are two ways you can do this.

166
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,081
You can either snap your fingers,

167
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:27,060
or click your tongue.

168
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:28,056
I can't do that very well.

169
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:30,048
But there are blind people

170
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:31,097
today that are actually being

171
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:33,042
trained in schools to do this

172
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,060
and learn to interpret the pattern

173
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,037
of sounds bouncing off your environment - that's sonar.

174
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:39,086
So, if after you search

175
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:42,031
on YouTube, there are

176
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,004
actually videos of this amazing kid who

177
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,076
tragically because of cancer

178
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,001
had his eyeballs removed, so this is a kid with no eyeballs.

179
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:51,074
But by snapping his fingers, he

180
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:53,066
can walk around and never hit anything.

181
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:55,038
He can ride a skateboard.

182
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,048
He can shoot a basketball into a

183
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,036
hoop and this is a kid with no eyeballs.

184
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,012
Third example is the

185
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:05,000
Haptic Belt where if

186
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:07,025
you have a strap

187
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,089
around your waist, ring up

188
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:11,070
buzzers and always have the northmost one buzzing.

189
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:13,044
You can give a human a

190
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,077
direction sense similar to

191
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:18,075
maybe how birds can, you know, sense where north is.

192
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:21,052
And, some of the bizarre example, but

193
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:22,081
if you plug a third eye

194
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,007
into a frog, the frog

195
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:25,082
will learn to use that eye as well.

196
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,022
So, it's pretty amazing to

197
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:31,030
what extent is as if

198
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:32,063
you can plug in almost any sensor

199
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:34,014
to the brain and the brain's

200
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:35,093
learning algorithm will just figure

201
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:37,051
out how to learn from that

202
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,017
data and deal with that data.

203
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,027
And there's a sense that

204
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:42,083
if we can figure out what

205
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:45,036
the brain's learning algorithm is, and,

206
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,077
you know, implement it or implement some approximation

207
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:49,039
to that algorithm on a computer, maybe

208
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,075
that would be our best shot

209
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,006
at, you know, making real progress

210
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,031
towards the AI, the

211
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,092
artificial intelligence dream of

212
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,006
someday building truly intelligent machines.

213
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:00,041
Now, of course, I'm not

214
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:02,031
teaching Neural Networks, you know,

215
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,058
just because they might give us

216
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,074
a window into this far-off

217
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,018
AI dream, even though I'm

218
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,050
personally, that's one of the things

219
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:09,088
that I personally work on in my research life.

220
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,068
But the main reason I'm

221
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,088
teaching Neural Networks in this

222
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,051
class is because it's actually a

223
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,082
very effective state of the

224
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,033
art technique for modern day machine learning applications.

225
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,033
So, in the next

226
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:22,016
few videos, we'll start diving into

227
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:23,082
the technical details of Neural

228
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:25,027
Networks so that you

229
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,045
can apply them to modern-day

230
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:28,056
machine learning applications and get

231
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,086
them to work well on problems.

232
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,018
But for me, you know, one

233
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:33,072
of the reasons the excite me  is

234
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,044
that maybe they give

235
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,000
us this window into

236
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,066
what we might do if

237
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:41,069
we're also thinking of

238
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:43,060
what algorithms might someday be

239
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:46,000
able to learn in a manner similar to humankind.
