1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,029
By now you have seen a lot of different learning algorithms.

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:04,045
And if you've been following along

3
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:06,003
these videos you should consider

4
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:09,052
yourself an expert on many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

5
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:12,031
But even among

6
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:14,046
people that know a certain learning algorithm.

7
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:16,082
There's often a huge difference between

8
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:18,023
someone that really knows how

9
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,012
to powerfully and effectively apply

10
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:22,026
that algorithm, versus someone that's

11
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:24,008
less familiar with some of

12
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:25,007
the material that I'm about

13
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:26,089
to teach and who doesn't really

14
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,008
understand how to apply these

15
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,017
algorithms and can end up

16
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:30,076
wasting a lot of

17
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:33,032
their time trying things out that don't really make sense.

18
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:35,017
What I would like to do is

19
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,035
make sure that if you

20
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:37,082
are developing machine learning systems,

21
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,078
that you know how to choose

22
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,089
one of the most promising avenues to spend your time pursuing.

23
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:45,004
And on this and the next

24
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:46,053
few videos I'm going to

25
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:47,089
give a number of practical

26
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:51,014
suggestions, advice, guidelines on how to do that.

27
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,040
And concretely what we'd

28
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,046
focus on is the problem

29
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:56,038
of, suppose you are

30
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,075
developing a machine learning system

31
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,039
or trying to improve the performance

32
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:01,081
of a machine learning system, how

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,063
do you go about deciding what are

34
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,026
the proxy avenues to try

35
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:07,062
next?

36
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,020
To explain this, let's continue using

37
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,020
our example of learning to

38
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,028
predict housing prices.

39
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:17,076
And let's say you've implement and regularize linear regression.

40
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,009
Thus minimizing that cost function

41
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,087
j.  Now suppose that

42
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,031
after you take your learn parameters,

43
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,056
if you test your hypothesis on

44
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,035
the new set of houses, suppose you

45
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,046
find that this is making huge

46
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:31,076
errors in this prediction of the housing prices.

47
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:34,048
The question is what should

48
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:37,059
you then try mixing in order to improve the learning algorithm?

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There are many things that one

50
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,045
can think of that could improve

51
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,065
the performance of the learning algorithm.

52
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,051
One thing they could try, is to get more training examples.

53
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:49,023
And concretely, you can imagine, maybe, you

54
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:51,015
know, setting up phone surveys, going

55
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,081
door to door, to try to

56
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:54,004
get more data on how much

57
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,065
different houses sell for.

58
00:01:57,073 --> 00:01:58,076
And the sad thing is I've seen

59
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,006
a lot of people spend a

60
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,040
lot of time collecting more training

61
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:03,026
examples, thinking oh, if we have

62
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:04,078
twice as much or ten times

63
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,025
as much training data, that is certainly going to help, right?

64
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:09,002
But sometimes getting more training

65
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:10,068
data doesn't actually help

66
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:11,091
and in the next few videos

67
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:13,066
we will see why, and we

68
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:15,027
will see how you

69
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,078
can avoid spending a lot

70
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,015
of time collecting more training data

71
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,065
in settings where it is just not going to help.

72
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:23,050
Other things you might try are

73
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:25,083
to well maybe try a smaller set of features.

74
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,027
So if you have some set

75
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:29,003
of features such as x1,

76
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,033
x2, x3 and so on,

77
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,084
maybe a large number of features.

78
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:33,046
Maybe you want to spend time

79
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,024
carefully selecting some small

80
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:37,040
subset of them to prevent overfitting.

81
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,072
Or maybe you need to get additional features.

82
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,038
Maybe the current set of features

83
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,074
aren't informative enough and you

84
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:47,046
want to collect more data in the sense of getting more features.

85
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,059
And once again this is the

86
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:50,090
sort of project that can scale

87
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,025
up the huge projects can you

88
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:54,011
imagine getting phone

89
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,028
surveys to find out more

90
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,022
houses, or extra land

91
00:02:57,063 --> 00:02:58,062
surveys to find out more

92
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,012
about the pieces of land and so on, so a huge project.

93
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:02,081
And once again it would be

94
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,013
nice to know in advance if

95
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,021
this is going to help before we

96
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:07,068
spend a lot of time doing something like this.

97
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,038
We can also try

98
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:12,009
adding polynomial features things like

99
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:13,009
x2 square x2 square and product

100
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:14,069
features x1, x2.

101
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,003
We can still spend quite a

102
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:17,083
lot of time thinking about that and

103
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:19,034
we can also try other things like

104
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:21,038
decreasing lambda, the regularization parameter or increasing lambda.

105
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:25,015
Given a menu of options

106
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,068
like these, some of which

107
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:28,024
can easily scale up to

108
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:30,000
six month or longer projects.

109
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,065
Unfortunately, the most common

110
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,000
method that people use to

111
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,003
pick one of these is to go by gut feeling.

112
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,066
In which what many people

113
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,052
will do is sort of randomly

114
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,009
pick one of these options and

115
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:43,005
maybe say, "Oh, lets go and get more training data."

116
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,047
And easily spend six months collecting

117
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:47,053
more training data or maybe someone

118
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,086
else would rather be saying, "Well,

119
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:51,081
let's go collect a lot more features on these houses in our data set."

120
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,000
And I have a lot

121
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:55,087
of times, sadly seen people spend, you know,

122
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:58,036
literally 6 months doing one

123
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,068
of these avenues that they have

124
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:01,081
sort of at random only to

125
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,021
discover six months later that

126
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:05,061
that really wasn't a promising avenue to pursue.

127
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,016
Fortunately, there is a

128
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:10,065
pretty simple technique that can

129
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,063
let you very quickly rule

130
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,018
out half of the things

131
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,043
on this list as being potentially

132
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,099
promising things to pursue.

133
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:19,031
And there is a very simple technique,

134
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:21,007
that if you run, can easily

135
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,081
rule out many of these options,

136
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:25,047
and potentially save you

137
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:28,060
a lot of time pursuing something that's just is not going to work.

138
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,094
In the next two videos

139
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,044
after this, I'm going to

140
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:35,042
first talk about how to evaluate learning algorithms.

141
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:37,081
And in the next few

142
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:39,076
videos after that, I'm

143
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:41,012
going to talk about these techniques,

144
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:44,026
which are called the machine learning diagnostics.

145
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:47,098
And what a diagnostic is, is

146
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,007
a test you can run,

147
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,024
to get insight into what

148
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,074
is or isn't working with

149
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,081
an algorithm, and which will

150
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,072
often give you insight as to

151
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:59,036
what are promising things to try

152
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,010
to improve a learning algorithm's

153
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:03,091
performance.

154
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:07,013
We'll talk about specific diagnostics later in this video sequence.

155
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:09,023
But I should mention in advance

156
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,077
that diagnostics can take

157
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,027
time to implement and can sometimes,

158
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:14,030
you know, take quite a

159
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,061
lot of time to implement and

160
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:17,012
understand but doing so

161
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,032
can be a very good use

162
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:19,037
of your time when you are

163
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:21,045
developing learning algorithms because they

164
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:22,066
can often save you from

165
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:24,067
spending many months pursuing an

166
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,057
avenue that you could

167
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:29,045
have found out much earlier just was not going to be fruitful.

168
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,006
So in the next few

169
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,025
videos, I'm going to first

170
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:36,022
talk about how evaluate your

171
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,020
learning algorithms and after

172
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,020
that I'm going to talk

173
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,049
about some of these diagnostics which will hopefully

174
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,094
let you much more

175
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,047
effectively select more of the

176
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,087
useful things to try mixing

177
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,019
if your goal to improve

178
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,043
the machine learning system.
