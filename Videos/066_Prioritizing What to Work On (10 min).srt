1
00:00:01,017 --> 00:00:02,041
In the next few videos I'd

2
00:00:02,056 --> 00:00:04,078
like to talk about machine learning system design.

3
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:06,095
These videos will touch on

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:08,036
the main issues that you may

5
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:10,014
face when designing a

6
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:11,044
complex machine learning system,

7
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:13,031
and will actually try to give

8
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,067
advice on how to

9
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:17,057
strategize putting together a complex machine learning system.

10
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:20,019
In case this next set

11
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:21,039
of videos seems a little

12
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:23,014
disjointed that's because these

13
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:24,033
videos will touch on a

14
00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:25,080
range of the different issues that

15
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,021
you may come across when designing complex learning systems.

16
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,007
And even though the

17
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:32,027
next set of videos may seem

18
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:34,074
somewhat less mathematical, I think

19
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:36,017
that this material may turn

20
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,028
out to be very useful, and

21
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,064
potentially huge time savers

22
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:41,060
when you're building big machine learning systems.

23
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:44,014
Concretely, I'd like to

24
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:45,071
begin with the issue of

25
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:47,050
prioritizing how to spend

26
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:48,067
your time on what to work

27
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:50,032
on, and I'll begin

28
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:52,021
with an example on spam classification.

29
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:57,028
Let's say you want to build a spam classifier.

30
00:00:58,053 --> 00:00:59,074
Here are a couple of examples

31
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:02,034
of obvious spam and non-spam emails.

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,034
if the one on the left tried to sell things.

33
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:07,064
And notice how spammers

34
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:10,007
will deliberately misspell words,

35
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:13,046
like Vincent with a 1 there, and mortgages.

36
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,034
And on the right as maybe

37
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:17,076
an obvious example of non-stamp

38
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,068
email, actually email from my younger brother.

39
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,093
Let's say we have a labeled

40
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,056
training set of some

41
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,012
number of spam emails and

42
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:28,020
some non-spam emails denoted

43
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:30,078
with labels y equals 1 or 0,

44
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:32,059
how do we build a

45
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,090
classifier using supervised learning

46
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:37,012
to distinguish between spam and non-spam?

47
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:39,067
In order to apply supervised learning,

48
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,043
the first decision we must

49
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:43,018
make is how do

50
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:44,085
we want to represent x, that

51
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,059
is the features of the email.

52
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:48,090
Given the features x and

53
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,029
the labels y in our

54
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,051
training set, we can then

55
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:54,065
train a classifier, for example using logistic regression.

56
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,012
Here's one way to choose

57
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:59,062
a set of features for our emails.

58
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,093
We could come up with,

59
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,062
say, a list of maybe

60
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,017
a hundred words that we think

61
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,084
are indicative of whether e-mail

62
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:09,022
is spam or non-spam, for

63
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:10,040
example, if a piece of

64
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:11,063
e-mail contains the word 'deal'

65
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,034
maybe it's more likely to be

66
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,040
spam if it contains

67
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:16,028
the word  'buy' maybe more

68
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,066
likely to be spam, a

69
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,034
word like 'discount' is more

70
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:20,090
likely to be spam, whereas if

71
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,034
a piece of email contains my name,

72
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,034
Andrew, maybe that means

73
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,087
the person actually knows who

74
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,074
I am and that might mean it's

75
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,009
less likely to be spam.

76
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,058
And maybe for some reason I think

77
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:33,099
the word "now" may be

78
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,068
indicative of non-spam because

79
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,015
I get a lot of urgent

80
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:39,037
emails, and so on,

81
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:41,021
and maybe we choose a hundred words or so.

82
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,050
Given a piece of email,

83
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,093
we can then take this piece

84
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:46,021
of email and encode

85
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:47,096
it into a feature

86
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:49,093
vector as follows.

87
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:51,044
I'm going to take my list of a

88
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,056
hundred words and sort

89
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:56,062
them in alphabetical order say.

90
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:57,097
It doesn't have to be sorted.

91
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,090
But, you know, here's a, here's

92
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,008
my list of words, just count

93
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:03,094
and so on, until eventually

94
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,043
I'll get down to now, and so

95
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,022
on and given a piece

96
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:08,053
of e-mail like that shown on the

97
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:09,063
right, I'm going to

98
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:11,040
check and see whether or

99
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,056
not each of these words

100
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,056
appears in the e-mail and then

101
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm going to define a feature

102
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:19,012
vector x where in

103
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:20,025
this piece of an email on

104
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,052
the right, my name doesn't

105
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:23,021
appear so I'm gonna put a zero there.

106
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,040
The word "by" does appear,

107
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,068
so I'm gonna put a one there

108
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,044
and I'm just gonna put one's or zeroes.

109
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,055
I'm gonna put a

110
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:33,094
one even though the word "by" occurs twice.

111
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,049
I'm not gonna recount how many times the word occurs.

112
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:40,028
The word "due" appears, I put a one there.

113
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,044
The word "discount" doesn't appear, at

114
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:43,068
least not in this this little

115
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,013
short email, and so on.

116
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:48,074
The word "now" does appear and so on.

117
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:50,025
So I put ones and zeroes

118
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:52,056
in this feature vector depending on

119
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:54,022
whether or not a particular word appears.

120
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,074
And in this example my

121
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,084
feature vector would have

122
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:00,091
to mention one hundred,

123
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:03,096
if I have a hundred,

124
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,046
if if I chose a hundred

125
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:06,084
words to use for

126
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,097
this representation and each

127
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:13,006
of my features Xj will

128
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,015
basically be 1 if

129
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,041
you have a particular word that,

130
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,093
we'll call this word j, appears

131
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,093
in the email and Xj

132
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:23,091
would be zero otherwise.

133
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:25,069
Okay.

134
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,043
So that gives me

135
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,022
a feature representation of a piece of email.

136
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,006
By the way, even though I've

137
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,025
described this process as manually

138
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,079
picking a hundred words, in

139
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:38,050
practice what's most commonly

140
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,013
done is to look through

141
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,070
a training set, and in

142
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,098
the training set depict the

143
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,068
most frequently occurring n words

144
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,029
where n is usually between ten

145
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,031
thousand and fifty thousand, and use

146
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,081
those as your features.

147
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:52,091
So rather than manually picking a

148
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,022
hundred words, here you look

149
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:56,002
through the training examples and

150
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:57,056
pick the most frequently occurring words

151
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:58,086
like ten thousand to fifty thousand

152
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:00,068
words, and those form the

153
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,055
features that you are going

154
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:04,031
to use to represent your email for spam classification.

155
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,085
Now, if you're building a

156
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:09,001
spam classifier one question

157
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:11,025
that you may face is, what's

158
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,057
the best use of your time

159
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:14,081
in order to make your

160
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:17,050
spam classifier have higher accuracy, you have lower error.

161
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:21,035
One natural inclination is going to collect lots of data.

162
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:21,077
Right?

163
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,012
And in fact there's this tendency

164
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:24,067
to think that, well the

165
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,058
more data we have the better the algorithm will do.

166
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,085
And in fact, in the email

167
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,050
spam domain, there are actually

168
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,083
pretty serious projects called Honey

169
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,031
Pot Projects, which create fake

170
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,008
email addresses and try to

171
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,091
get these fake email addresses into

172
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:40,070
the hands of spammers and use

173
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,087
that to try to collect tons

174
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,043
of spam email, and therefore

175
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:46,012
you know, get a lot of spam data to train learning algorithms.

176
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:48,075
But we've already seen in the

177
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,062
previous sets of videos

178
00:05:50,064 --> 00:05:53,033
that getting lots of data will often help, but not all the time.

179
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,081
But for most machine learning problems,

180
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:57,027
there are a lot of other things

181
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,077
you could usually imagine doing to improve performance.

182
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:02,012
For spam, one thing you

183
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,042
might think of is to develop

184
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,062
more sophisticated features on the

185
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:08,006
email, maybe based on the email routing information.

186
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,092
And this would be information contained in the email header.

187
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:14,081
So, when spammers send email,

188
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,042
very often they will try

189
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:18,011
to obscure the origins of

190
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,025
the email, and maybe

191
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,087
use fake email headers.

192
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,006
Or send email through very

193
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,036
unusual sets of computer service.

194
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:29,087
Through very unusual routes, in order to get the spam to you.

195
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:33,068
And some of this information will be reflected in the email header.

196
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,060
And so one can imagine,

197
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,030
looking at the email headers and

198
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,006
trying to develop more sophisticated features

199
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,075
to capture this sort of

200
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,076
email routing information to identify if something is spam.

201
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:47,088
Something else you might consider doing

202
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:49,030
is to look at the

203
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,086
email message body, that is

204
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,035
the email text, and try to develop more sophisticated features.

205
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,031
For example, should the word

206
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,056
'discount' and the word

207
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,033
'discounts' be treated as

208
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:01,081
the same words or should

209
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:04,012
we have treat the words 'deal' and 'dealer' as the same word?

210
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:05,061
Maybe even though one is

211
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:08,001
lower case and one in capitalized in this example.

212
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:10,052
Or do we want more complex features about punctuation because maybe spam

213
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:14,011
is using exclamation marks a lot more.

214
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:14,073
I don't know.

215
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:16,085
And along the same lines, maybe

216
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,056
we also want to develop more

217
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:20,037
sophisticated algorithms to detect

218
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:22,069
and maybe to correct to deliberate misspellings,

219
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,069
like mortgage, medicine, watches.

220
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,088
Because spammers actually do this,

221
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,039
because if you have watches

222
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,006
with a 4 in there then well,

223
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,072
with the simple technique that we

224
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,075
talked about just now, the spam

225
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,027
classifier might not equate

226
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,017
this as the same thing as the

227
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:40,025
word "watches," and so it

228
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:41,043
may have a harder time realizing

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,093
that something is spam with these deliberate misspellings.

230
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:45,093
And this is why spammers do it.

231
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:49,027
While working on a machine learning

232
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:51,037
problem, very often you

233
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:54,068
can brainstorm lists of different things to try, like these.

234
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,056
By the way, I've actually

235
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,048
worked on the spam

236
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:00,000
problem myself for a while.

237
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,061
And I actually spent quite some time on it.

238
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,004
And even though I kind

239
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:04,035
of understand the spam problem,

240
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,081
I actually know a bit about it,

241
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:07,037
I would actually have a very

242
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,016
hard time telling you of

243
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,079
these four options which is

244
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:12,018
the best use of your time

245
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,018
so what happens, frankly what

246
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,079
happens far too often is

247
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:17,024
that a research group or

248
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:20,032
product group will randomly fixate on one of these options.

249
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:22,087
And sometimes that turns

250
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,035
out not to be the most

251
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:25,061
fruitful way to spend your

252
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:27,069
time depending, you know, on which

253
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,039
of these options someone ends up randomly fixating on.

254
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:32,066
By the way, in fact, if

255
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,077
you even get to the stage

256
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,071
where you brainstorm a list

257
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,010
of different options to try, you're

258
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:38,074
probably already ahead of the curve.

259
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,019
Sadly, what most people do is

260
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,015
instead of trying to list

261
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,000
out the options of things

262
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,050
you might try, what far too

263
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,010
many people do is wake up

264
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:47,037
one morning and, for some

265
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:48,085
reason, just, you know, have a weird

266
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,044
gut feeling that, "Oh let's

267
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:52,066
have a huge honeypot project

268
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,057
to go and collect tons more data"

269
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:56,086
and for whatever strange reason just

270
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:58,053
sort of wake up one morning and randomly

271
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,033
fixate on one thing and just

272
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,034
work on that for six months.

273
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,016
But I think we can do better.

274
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:06,012
And in particular what I'd

275
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,012
like to do in the next

276
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,040
video is tell you about

277
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,088
the concept of error analysis

278
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:12,052
and talk about the way

279
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:15,014
where you can try

280
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:16,083
to have a more systematic way

281
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:18,063
to choose amongst the options

282
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:19,095
of the many different things you

283
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,073
might work, and therefore be

284
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:23,042
more likely to select what

285
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,082
is actually a good way

286
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:26,007
to spend your time, you know

287
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,091
for the next few weeks, or next few days or the next few months.
