00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:01,074
In this video, I'd like to

2
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:02,096
tell you a bit about the

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,067
math behind large margin classification.

4
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:08,039
This video is optional, so please feel free to skip it.

5
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:10,038
It may also give you better

6
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:11,098
intuition about how the

7
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,083
optimization problem of the

8
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,053
support vex machine, how that

9
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,014
leads to large margin classifiers.

10
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:22,053
In order to get started, let

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,073
me first remind you of a

12
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:26,048
couple of properties of what vector inner products look like.

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,028
Let's say I have two vectors

14
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:32,017
U and V, that look like this.

15
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:34,017
So both two dimensional vectors.

16
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,093
Then let's see what U

17
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:39,054
transpose V looks like.

18
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:42,017
And U transpose V is

19
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:43,071
also called the inner products

20
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,088
between the vectors U and V.

21
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:49,096
Use a two dimensional vector, so

22
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:51,093
I can on plot it on this figure.

23
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,085
So let's say

24
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,085
that's the vector U. And

25
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,092
what I mean by that is

26
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,015
if on the horizontal axis that

27
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:00,082
value takes whatever value

28
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:03,028
U1 is and on the

29
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:04,081
vertical axis the height

30
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:06,035
of that is whatever U2

31
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,053
is the second component

32
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:12,057
of the vector U. Now, one

33
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:13,076
quantity that will be nice

34
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,043
to have is the norm

35
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,054
of the vector U. So, these

36
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,039
are, you know, double bars on

37
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:20,037
the left and right that denotes

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,060
the norm or length of

39
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:23,093
U. So this just means; really the

40
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,032
euclidean length of the

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,079
vector U. And this

42
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:33,059
is Pythagoras theorem is just

43
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,042
equal to U1

44
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,029
squared plus U2

45
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:40,018
squared square root, right?

46
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:42,078
And this is the length of the vector U. That's a real number.

47
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:44,075
Just say you know, what is the length

48
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,012
of this, what is the

49
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,090
length of this vector down here.

50
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,048
What is the length of this

51
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,098
arrow that I just drew, is the normal view?

52
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,029
Now let's go back and

53
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:59,065
look at the vector V because we want to compute the inner product.

54
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:01,037
So V will be some other

55
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:03,015
vector with, you know,

56
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:06,090
some value V1, V2.

57
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:10,049
And so, the vector

58
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:15,005
V will look like that, towards V like so.

59
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:18,025
Now let's go back

60
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:19,087
and look at how to compute

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,061
the inner product between U

62
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,031
and V. Here's how you can do it.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,078
Let me take the vector V and

64
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,043
project it down onto the

65
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,069
vector U. So I'm going

66
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,090
to take a orthogonal projection or

67
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:33,069
a 90 degree projection, and project

68
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:35,049
it down onto U like so.

69
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,040
And what I'm going to do

70
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:39,047
measure length of this

71
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,052
red line that I just drew here.

72
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,062
So, I'm going to call the length of

73
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:44,066
that red line P. So, P

74
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,083
is the length or is

75
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:48,022
the magnitude of the projection

76
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:51,066
of the vector V onto the

77
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:54,037
vector U. Let me just write that down.

78
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:55,059
So, P is the length

79
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,015
of the projection of the

80
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:05,080
vector V onto the

81
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:08,021
vector U. And it is

82
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:10,050
possible to show that unit

83
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:12,071
product U transpose V, that

84
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:13,053
this is going to be equal

85
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:16,033
to P  times the

86
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:18,002
norm or the length of

87
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:21,012
the vector U. So, this

88
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,040
is one way to compute the inner product.

89
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,059
And if you actually do

90
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:27,015
the geometry figure out what

91
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,028
P is and figure out what the norm of U is.

92
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,068
This should give you the same

93
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,033
way, the same answer as

94
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:33,084
the other way of computing unit product.

95
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:34,086
Right.

96
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,013
Which is if you take U

97
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:38,015
transpose V then U transposes

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,093
this U1 U2, its a

99
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:42,065
one by two matrix, 1

100
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,025
times V. And so

101
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:46,093
this should actually give you

102
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:50,062
U1, V1 plus U2, V2.

103
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,013
And so the theorem of

104
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,000
linear algebra that these two

105
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:56,087
formulas give you the same answer.

106
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,071
And by the way, U transpose

107
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:01,000
V is also equal to

108
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,049
V transpose U. So if

109
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:04,050
you were to do the same process

110
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,086
in reverse, instead of projecting

111
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,012
V onto U, you could project

112
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:09,093
U onto V. Then, you know, do

113
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:12,040
the same process, but with the rows of U and V reversed.

114
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:14,038
And you would actually, you should

115
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,089
actually get the same number whatever that number is.

116
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:18,079
And just to clarify what's

117
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,085
going on in this equation the

118
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:21,092
norm of U is a real

119
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,025
number and P is also a real number.

120
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:28,072
And so U transpose V is

121
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,035
the regular multiplication as two real numbers of

122
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:34,043
the length of P times the normal view.

123
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,095
Just one last detail, which is

124
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:38,024
if you look at the norm of

125
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,025
P, P is actually signed so to the right.

126
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:43,024
And it can either be positive or negative.

127
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:45,052
So let me say what I mean

128
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:46,074
by that, if U

129
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:49,036
is a vector that looks like

130
00:04:49,063 --> 00:04:51,036
this and V is a vector that looks like this.

131
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:53,088
So if the angle between U

132
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,076
and V is greater than ninety degrees.

133
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,095
Then if I project V onto

134
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:00,022
U, what I get

135
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,058
is a projection it looks like

136
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:03,086
this and so that length

137
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,049
P. And in this

138
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,089
case, I will still have

139
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,050
that U transpose V is

140
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,072
equal to P times the

141
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,006
norm of U. Except in

142
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,060
this example P will be negative.

143
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,099
So, you know, in inner products if the angle

144
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:22,054
between U and V is less

145
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,081
than ninety degrees, then P

146
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,048
is the positive length for that red line

147
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,042
whereas if the angle of this

148
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:29,063
angle of here is greater

149
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,088
than 90 degrees then P

150
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:33,087
here will be negative of

151
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:37,025
the length of the super line of that little line segment right over there.

152
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:38,075
So the inner product between two

153
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,012
vectors can also be negative

154
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:42,089
if the angle between them is greater than 90 degrees.

155
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,010
So that's how vector inner

156
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:46,049
products work. We're going to

157
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:47,095
use these properties of vector

158
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:49,061
inner product to try

159
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,087
to understand the support

160
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,049
vector machine optimization objective over there. Here

161
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,062
is the optimization objective for the

162
00:05:58,064 --> 00:06:00,089
support vector machine that we worked out earlier. Just for

163
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,006
the purpose of this slide I

164
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,051
am going to make one simplification or

165
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:08,022
once just to make the objective easy

166
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,011
to analyze and what I'm going to do is

167
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:14,016
ignore the indeceptrums. So, we'll just ignore theta 0 and set that to be equal to 0. To

168
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:22,094
make things easier to plot, I'm also going to set N the number of features to be equal to 2. So, we have only 2 features,

169
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:24,070
X1 and X2.

170
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,098
Now, let's look at the objective function.

171
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:29,091
The optimization objective of the

172
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,012
SVM. What we have only two features.

173
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,070
When N is equal to 2.

174
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,033
This can be written,

175
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,089
one half of

176
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:40,007
theta one squared plus theta two squared.

177
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,087
Because we only have two parameters, theta one and thetaa two.

178
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:46,073
What I'm going to do is rewrite this a bit.

179
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:47,089
I'm going to write this as one

180
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,098
half of theta one

181
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,086
squared plus theta two squared and

182
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,016
the square root squared.

183
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,075
And the reason I can do that,

184
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,099
is because for any number, you know, W, right, the

185
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:02,048
square roots of W and

186
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,093
then squared, that's just equal

187
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,064
to W. So square roots

188
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,025
and squared should give you the same thing.

189
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,050
What you may notice is that

190
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:11,087
this term inside is that's

191
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:13,044
equal to the norm

192
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:16,045
or the length of the

193
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,025
vector theta and what

194
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:20,001
I mean by that is that

195
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,063
if we write out the

196
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,058
vector theta like this, as

197
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,031
you know theta one, theta two.

198
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,025
Then this term that I've just

199
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,023
underlined in red, that's exactly

200
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:30,048
the length, or the norm, of the vector theta.

201
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:32,018
We are calling the definition

202
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:35,005
of the norm of the vector that we have on the previous line.

203
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:37,004
And in fact this is actually

204
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,031
equal to the length of the

205
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,075
vector theta, whether you write

206
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,062
it as theta zero, theta 1, theta 2.

207
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:45,023
That is, if theta zero is equal to zero, as I assume here.

208
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,076
Or just the length of theta

209
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,068
1, theta 2; but for

210
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:50,044
this line I am going to ignore theta 0.

211
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:52,070
So let me just, you know, treat theta

212
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,073
as this, let me just

213
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:56,036
write theta, the normal

214
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:58,048
theta as this theta 1,

215
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,018
theta 2 only, but the

216
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,022
math works out either way,

217
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,079
whether we include theta zero here or not.

218
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:05,087
So it's not going to matter for the rest of our derivation.

219
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:09,012
And so finally this means

220
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,043
that my optimization objective is equal

221
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,010
to one half of the

222
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:14,061
norm of theta squared.

223
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:17,023
So all the support vector machine

224
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:19,000
is doing in the optimization

225
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,050
objective is it's minimizing the

226
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:23,010
squared norm of the square

227
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:24,083
length of the parameter vector theta.

228
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:29,016
Now what I'd like to do

229
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,079
is look at these terms, theta

230
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,066
transpose X and understand better what they're doing.

231
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:36,060
So given the parameter vector theta and given

232
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:39,087
and example x, what is this is equal to?

233
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:42,012
And on the previous slide, we

234
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:44,007
figured out what U transpose

235
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:45,085
V looks like, with different

236
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,087
vectors U and V. And so we're

237
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:50,034
going to take those definitions, you know, with theta

238
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:52,029
and X(i) playing the

239
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,030
roles of U and V.

240
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,042
And let's see what that picture looks like.

241
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:59,015
So, let's say I plot. Let's say I look at

242
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:01,012
just a single training example. Let's say I

243
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:03,036
have a positive example the drawing

244
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:05,004
was across there and let's say that is

245
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:09,030
my example X(i), what

246
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,097
that really means is

247
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,050
plotted on the horizontal axis

248
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:16,021
some value X(i) 1

249
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:19,062
and on the vertical axis

250
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:22,028
X(i) 2.

251
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:24,007
That's how I plot my training examples.

252
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,015
And although we haven't been really

253
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:28,030
thinking of this as a vector, what

254
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,060
this really is, this is a

255
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:30,090
vector from the origin

256
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,051
from 0, 0 out to

257
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:36,021
the location of this training example.

258
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,046
And now let's say we have

259
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:41,085
a parameter vector and

260
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:43,062
I'm going to plot

261
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,072
that as vector, as well.

262
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:48,040
What I mean by that is if I plot theta 1

263
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,052
here and theta 2 there

264
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:57,004
so what is the inner

265
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:58,094
product theta transpose X(i).

266
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:01,024
While using our earlier method,

267
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:03,036
the way we compute that is we

268
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,016
take my example and

269
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:08,071
project it onto my parameter vector theta.

270
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,070
And then I'm going to look

271
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:13,007
at the length of this segment

272
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:14,065
that I'm coloring in, in red.

273
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:16,050
And I'm going to

274
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:19,048
call that P superscript I

275
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,033
to denote that this is a

276
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,091
projection of the i-th training example

277
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:25,053
onto the parameter vector theta.

278
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,013
And so what we have is

279
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:30,078
that theta transpose X(i) is

280
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,083
equal to following what

281
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,021
we have on the previous slide, this

282
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,035
is going to be equal to

283
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:40,000
P times the

284
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,009
length of the norm of the vector theta.

285
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,069
And this is of course also equal to

286
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,065
theta 1 x1

287
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:50,061
plus theta 2 x2. So each

288
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,036
of these is, you know, an equally

289
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,008
valid way of computing the

290
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:56,015
inner product between theta and X(i).

291
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:57,077
Okay.

292
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,003
So where does this leave us?

293
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,076
What this means is that, this

294
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,088
constrains that theta transpose X(i)

295
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:05,033
be greater than or equal to one or less than minus one.

296
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:06,086
What this means is that it

297
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:07,083
can replace the use of constraints

298
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:12,000
that P(i) times X

299
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,050
be greater than or equal to one.

300
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:16,027
Because theta transpose X(i) is

301
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,047
equal to P(i) times the norm of theta.

302
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,008
So writing that into our optimization objective.

303
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,087
This is what we get

304
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:26,028
where I have, instead of

305
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,039
theta transpose X(i), I now

306
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,091
have this P(i) times the norm of theta.

307
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,097
And just to remind you we

308
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,024
worked out earlier too that

309
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:36,030
this optimization objective can be

310
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,012
written as one half times

311
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,090
the norm of theta squared.

312
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:43,049
So, now let's consider

313
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:45,054
the training example that we

314
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,010
have at the bottom and

315
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:49,062
for now, continuing to use the simplification that

316
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:51,034
theta 0 is equal to 0.

317
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,080
Let's see what decision boundary the support vector machine will choose.

318
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:57,071
Here's one option, let's say

319
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,019
the support vector machine were to

320
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,075
choose this decision boundary.

321
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:05,011
This is not a very good choice because it has very small margins.

322
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:08,021
This decision boundary comes very close to the training examples.

323
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,036
Let's see why the support vector machine will not do this.

324
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,041
For this choice of parameters

325
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,027
it's possible to show that the

326
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:21,025
parameter vector theta is actually

327
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,035
at 90 degrees to the decision boundary.

328
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:25,044
And so, that green decision boundary

329
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,054
corresponds to a parameter vector

330
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,064
theta that points in that direction.

331
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:32,027
And by the way, the simplification that

332
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,012
theta 0 equals 0 that

333
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,040
just means that the decision boundary

334
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,096
must pass through the origin, (0,0) over there.

335
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,035
So now, let's

336
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:41,077
look at what this implies

337
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,059
for the optimization objective.

338
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:46,041
Let's say that this example here.

339
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:48,055
Let's say that's my first example, you know,

340
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:50,064
X1.

341
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:52,062
If we look at the projection

342
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:54,087
of this example onto my parameters theta.

343
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:56,051
That's the projection.

344
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,023
And so that little red line segment.

345
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,072
That is equal to P1.

346
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:04,064
And that is going to be pretty small, right.

347
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:08,059
And similarly, if this

348
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:10,071
example here, if this happens

349
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:12,062
to be X2, that's my second example.

350
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,062
Then, if I look at the projection of this this example onto theta.

351
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:18,016
You know.

352
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:20,046
Then, let me draw this one in magenta.

353
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,069
This little magenta line segment, that's

354
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,082
going to be P2. That's

355
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,037
the projection of the second example

356
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:28,087
onto my, onto the direction

357
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,064
of my parameter vector theta which goes like this.

358
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,025
And so, this little

359
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:35,026
projection line segment is getting pretty small.

360
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,062


361
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:38,041
P2 will actually be a negative number, right so P2 is

362
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:42,049
in the opposite direction.

363
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,025
This vector has greater

364
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:47,012
than 90 degree angle with my

365
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,098
parameter vector theta, it's going to be less than 0.

366
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,058
And so what we're finding is that

367
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:54,087
these terms P(i) are

368
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,023
going to be pretty small numbers.

369
00:13:58,021 --> 00:13:59,008
So if we look at

370
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:01,064
the optimization objective and see, well, for positive examples

371
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,086
we need P(i) times

372
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:07,059
the norm of theta to be bigger than either one.

373
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:10,063
But if P(i) over

374
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:12,013
here, if P1 over here

375
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:14,015
is pretty small, that means

376
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,058
that we need the norm of

377
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:18,041
theta to be pretty large, right? If

378
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,084
P1 of theta is small

379
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:23,011
and we want P1 you

380
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,060
know times in all of theta

381
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:25,088
to be bigger than either one, well

382
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,029
the only way for that

383
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,044
to be true for the profit that

384
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:29,075
these two numbers to be large

385
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,012
if P1 is small, as we

386
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,098
said we want the norm of theta to be large.

387
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:36,045
And similarly for our

388
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:38,055
negative example, we need P2

389
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,007
times the norm of

390
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:44,099
theta to be

391
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,090
less than or equal to minus one.

392
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:48,053
And we saw in this

393
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,020
example already that P2

394
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,051
is going pretty small negative number,

395
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:53,028
and so the only way for

396
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,049
that to happen as well is

397
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:56,073
for the norm of theta to be

398
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,062
large, but what

399
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,089
we are doing in the optimization

400
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:02,039
objective is we are

401
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:03,084
trying to find a setting

402
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:05,032
of parameters where the norm

403
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:07,010
of theta is small, and so

404
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,003
you know, so this doesn't

405
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,007
seem like such a good direction

406
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:14,015
for the parameter vector and theta.

407
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,050
In contrast, just look at a different decision boundary.

408
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,050
Here, let's say, this SVM chooses

409
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,027
that decision boundary.

410
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,098
Now the is going to be very different.

411
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,088
If that is the decision boundary,

412
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,037
here is the

413
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:28,076
corresponding direction for theta.

414
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:30,091
So, with the direction

415
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,011
boundary you know, that

416
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,055
vertical line that corresponds

417
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:35,096
to it is possible to

418
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,087
show using linear algebra that

419
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:39,013
the way to get that green decision

420
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:41,019
boundary is have the vector of theta be

421
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:42,062
at 90 degrees to it,

422
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:44,047
and now if you look

423
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,057
at the projection of your

424
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:47,053
data onto the vector

425
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000
x, lets say its before

426
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,062
this example is my example of x1. So when

427
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:54,060
I project this on to x,

428
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,011
or onto theta, what I find is that this is P1.

429
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,040
That length there is P1.

430
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,082
The other example, that

431
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:08,062
example is and I

432
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:11,029
do the same projection and

433
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,058
what I find is that this

434
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:14,067
length here is a

435
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,087
P2 really that is going to be less than 0.

436
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,094
And you notice that now

437
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,049
P1 and P2, these lengths

438
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,074
of the projections are going to

439
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,079
be much bigger, and so

440
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,046
if we still need to enforce

441
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,070
these constraints that P1 of

442
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,003
the norm of theta is phase

443
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,066
number one because P1 is so much bigger now.

444
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:39,011
The normal can be smaller.

445
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:43,009
And so, what this means is

446
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:44,032
that by choosing the decision

447
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:45,075
boundary shown on the right

448
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,061
instead of on the left, the

449
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:49,000
SVM can make the

450
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,055
norm of the parameters theta

451
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,041
much smaller. So, if we can

452
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,008
make the norm of theta smaller and

453
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,013
therefore make the squared norm of

454
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,008
theta smaller, which is

455
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:58,012
why the SVM

456
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:00,091
would choose this hypothesis on the right instead.

457
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,025
And this is how

458
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,016
the SVM gives rise

459
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,054
to this large margin certification effect.

460
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,061
Mainly, if you look

461
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:13,025
at this green line, if you look at this green

462
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:14,099
hypothesis we want the

463
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:16,025
projections of my positive

464
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,077
and negative examples onto theta to be large, and

465
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,035
the only way for that to

466
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:23,049
hold true this is if surrounding the green line.

467
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:27,071
There's this large margin, there's

468
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:31,046
this large gap that separates

469
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:37,024
positive and negative examples is

470
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,074
really the magnitude of this gap.

471
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:42,004
The magnitude of this margin

472
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,090
is exactly the values of

473
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,073
P1, P2, P3 and so on.

474
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:48,097
And so by making the margin

475
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,026
large, by these tyros P1,

476
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:53,065
P2, P3 and so on that's

477
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:55,051
the SVM can end up with

478
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,085
a smaller value for the

479
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:59,045
norm of theta which is what it is trying to do in the objective.

480
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:01,028
And this is why this

481
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,029
machine ends up with enlarge

482
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:05,050
margin classifiers because itss

483
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:07,056
trying to maximize the norm

484
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:08,091
of these P1 which is the distance from

485
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,045
the training examples to the decision boundary.

486
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,045
Finally, we did this whole derivation

487
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,058
using this simplification that the

488
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:21,015
parameter theta 0 must be equal to 0.

489
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,044
The effect of that as

490
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,038
I mentioned briefly, is that if

491
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:26,055
theta 0 is equal to

492
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:28,027
0 what that means

493
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:29,076
is that we are entertaining decision

494
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,050
boundaries that pass through the

495
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:33,064
origins of decision boundaries pass through

496
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,050
the origin like that, if you

497
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,098
allow theta zero to

498
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,053
be non 0 then what

499
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:41,019
that means is that you entertain the

500
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,011
decision boundaries that did not

501
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,073
cross through the origin, like that one I just drew.

502
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,094
And I'm not going to do

503
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,053
the full derivation that. It

504
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:50,059
turns out that this same

505
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,072
large margin proof works in

506
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,024
pretty much in exactly the same way.

507
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,009
And there's a generalization of this

508
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,082
argument that we just went through

509
00:18:58,002 --> 00:18:59,040
them long ago through that shows

510
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:01,053
that even when theta

511
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,069
0 is non 0, what

512
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:06,094
the SVM is trying to do when you have this optimization objective.

513
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,061
Which again corresponds to the

514
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,056
case of when C is very large.

515
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,010
But it is possible to

516
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,050
show that, you know, when theta

517
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,042
is not equal to 0 this

518
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:19,075
support vector machine is still

519
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,035
finding is really trying

520
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:22,065
to find the large margin

521
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:24,005
separator that between the positive and negative

522
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:28,020
examples. So that

523
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,005
explains how this support vector machine is a large margin classifier.

524
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:34,001
In the next video we

525
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,007
will start to talk about how

526
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,048
to take some of these

527
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:37,098
SVM ideas and start to

528
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,020
apply them to build a complex

529
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,036
nonlinear classifiers.
