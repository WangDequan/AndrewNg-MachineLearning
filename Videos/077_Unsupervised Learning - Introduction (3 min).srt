1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,031
In this video, I'd like to start to talk about clustering.

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:04,084
This will be exciting because this

3
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:06,091
is our first unsupervised learning algorithm

4
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:09,008
where we learn from unlabeled data

5
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,073
instead of the label data.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,030
So, what is unsupervised learning?

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,063
I briefly talked about unsupervised

8
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:17,046
learning at the beginning of

9
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:18,055
the class but it's useful

10
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,032
to contrast it with supervised learning. So, here's

11
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,075
a typical supervisory problem where

12
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,046
we are given a label training sets

13
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:27,046
and the goal is to find

14
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:29,042
the decision boundary that separates the

15
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:31,030
positive label examples and the negative label examples.

16
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,039
The supervised learning problem in

17
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:35,071
this case is given a

18
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:38,027
set of labels to fit a hypothesis to it.

19
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:40,056
In contrast, in the unsupervised

20
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,042
learning problem, we're given

21
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,074
data that does not have

22
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:45,027
any labels associated with it.

23
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:47,093
So we're given data that looks

24
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,009
like this, here's a set

25
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:50,046
of points and then no labels.

26
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,085
And so our training set is written

27
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,071
just x1, x2 and

28
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,089
so on up to x(m)

29
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:58,071
and we don't get any labels y.

30
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:00,079
And that's why the points plotted

31
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:02,029
up on the figure don't have

32
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:04,032
any labels on them.

33
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:05,051
So in unsupervised learning, what

34
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,085
we do is, we give this sort of

35
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:09,015
unlabeled training set to

36
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:10,051
an algorithm and we just

37
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,021
ask the algorithm: find some

38
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:14,012
structure in the data for us.

39
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,048
Given this data set, one

40
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:17,081
type of structure we might

41
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,054
have an algorithm find, is that

42
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,043
it looks like this data set has

43
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:23,073
points grouped into two

44
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,050
separate clusters and so

45
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,023
an algorithm that finds that

46
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:29,023
clusters like the ones I just

47
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,060
circled, is called a clustering

48
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:32,043
algorithm.

49
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,062
And this will be our first type of

50
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:36,059
unsupervised learning, although there

51
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,031
will be other types of unsupervised

52
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,020
learning algorithms that we'll talk

53
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,070
about later that finds other

54
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:43,070
types of structure or other

55
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:46,000
types of patterns in the data other than clusters.

56
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,035
We'll talk about this afterwards, we will talk about clustering.

57
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,020
So what is clustering good for?

58
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:54,034
Early in this class I had already mentioned a few applications.

59
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:56,054
One is market segmentation, where

60
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:57,068
you may have a database of

61
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,084
customers and want to group

62
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:00,037
them into different market segments.

63
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:02,059
So, you can sell to

64
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,056
them separately or serve your different market segments better.

65
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:08,037
Social network analysis, there are

66
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:10,009
actually, you know, groups that have done

67
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:12,059
this, things like looking at a

68
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:14,053
group of people, social networks,

69
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,038
so things like Facebook, Google plus

70
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,025
or maybe information about who

71
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,071
are the people that you

72
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:21,011
email the most frequently and who

73
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:22,016
are the people that they email

74
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:23,059
the most frequently, and

75
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,040
to find coherent groups of people.

76
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,059
So, this would be another maybe

77
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:28,084
clustering algorithm where, you know, you'd want

78
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:32,019
to find who other coherent groups of friends in a social network.

79
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:33,099
Here's something that one of my

80
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:35,016
friends actually worked on, which is,

81
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:37,019
use clustering to organize compute

82
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:39,021
clusters or to organize data

83
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,059
centers better because, if you

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,044
know which computers in the

85
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:44,099
data center are in the cluster there tend to work together.

86
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,027
You can use that to reorganize

87
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:48,038
your resources and how you

88
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:50,012
lay out its network and

89
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:52,003
how design your data center and communications.

90
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:54,053
And lastly something that, actually

91
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:55,090
another thing I worked on, using

92
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,081
clustering algorithms to understand

93
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,003
galaxy formation and using

94
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:02,025
that to understand how, to

95
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,086
understand astronomical detail.

96
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:08,058
So, that's clustering which

97
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,044
is our first example of

98
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:12,065
an unsupervised learning algorithm.

99
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,019
In the next video, we'll start to

100
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:16,025
talk about a specific clustering algorithm.
