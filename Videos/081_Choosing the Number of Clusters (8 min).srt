00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,038
In this video I'd like to

2
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:02,077
talk about one last detail

3
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:04,095
of K-means clustering which is

4
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:06,067
how to choose the number of

5
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:07,088
clusters, or how to choose

6
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:09,016
the value of the parameter

7
00:00:10,023 --> 00:00:12,031
capsule K. To be

8
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,068
honest, there actually isn't a

9
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:15,041
great way of answering this

10
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:17,014
or doing this automatically and

11
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:18,092
by far the most common way

12
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,037
of choosing the number of clusters,

13
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:22,003
is still choosing it manually

14
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:24,037
by looking at visualizations or by

15
00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:26,007
looking at the output of the clustering algorithm or something else.

16
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,026
But I do get asked

17
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,046
this question quite a lot of

18
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:30,051
how do you choose the number of

19
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,092
clusters, and so I just want

20
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,064
to tell you know what

21
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:35,002
are peoples' current thinking on

22
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:36,047
it although, the most

23
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:38,006
common thing is actually to

24
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,013
choose the number of clusters by hand.

25
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:43,067
A large part of

26
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,002
y, it might not always

27
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,053
be easy to choose the

28
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:47,093
number of clusters is that

29
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:51,092
it is often generally ambiguous how many clusters there are in the data.

30
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,089
Looking at this data set

31
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,010
some of you may see

32
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,082
four clusters and that

33
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,043
would suggest using K equals 4.

34
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:00,064
Or some of you may

35
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:02,061
see two clusters and

36
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:04,045
that will suggest K equals

37
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:06,062
2 and now this may see three clusters.

38
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:09,070
And so, looking at the

39
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:10,075
data set like this, the

40
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:12,039
true number of clusters, it actually

41
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:14,056
seems genuinely ambiguous to me,

42
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:17,015
and I don't think there is one right answer.

43
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:19,050
And this is part of our supervised learning.

44
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:21,045
We are aren't given labels, and

45
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:23,095
so there isn't always a clear cut answer.

46
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:25,073
And this is one of the

47
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,070
things that makes it more difficult

48
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,053
to say, have an automatic

49
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:30,085
algorithm for choosing how many clusters to have.

50
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,025
When people talk about ways of

51
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,026
choosing the number of clusters,

52
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:36,004
one method that people sometimes

53
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,015
talk about is something called the Elbow Method.

54
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:40,048
Let me just tell you a little bit about that,

55
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,076
and then mention some of its advantages but also shortcomings.

56
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:45,098
So the Elbow Method,

57
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,056
what we're going to do is vary

58
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:49,085
K, which is the total number of clusters.

59
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,056
So, we're going to run K-means

60
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,034
with one cluster, that means really,

61
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:54,084
everything gets grouped into a

62
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:56,053
single cluster and compute the

63
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:57,084
cost function or compute the distortion

64
00:01:58,045 --> 00:01:59,048
J and plot that here.

65
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,009
And then we're going to run K

66
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:03,026
means with two clusters, maybe

67
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,043
with multiple random initial agents, maybe not.

68
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:07,015
But then, you know,

69
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,028
with two clusters we should

70
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,050
get, hopefully, a smaller distortion,

71
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,081
and so plot that there.

72
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:13,009
And then run K-means with three

73
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:14,059
clusters, hopefully, you get even

74
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,068
smaller distortion and plot that there.

75
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,071
I'm gonna run K-means with four, five and so on.

76
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:20,078
And so we end up with

77
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,084
a curve showing how the

78
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:24,056
distortion, you know, goes

79
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,016
down as we increase the number of clusters.

80
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:29,087
And so we get a curve that maybe looks like this.

81
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:32,021
And if you look at this

82
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,040
curve, what the Elbow Method does

83
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,077
it says "Well, let's look at this plot.

84
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:39,034
Looks like there's a clear elbow there".

85
00:02:40,022 --> 00:02:41,062
Right, this is, would be by

86
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,021
analogy to the human arm where,

87
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,062
you know, if you imagine that

88
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:46,046
you reach out your arm,

89
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:48,093
then, this is your

90
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,034
shoulder joint, this is your

91
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:52,096
elbow joint and I guess, your hand is at the end over here.

92
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:54,016
And so this is the Elbow Method.

93
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,093
Then you find this sort of pattern

94
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,062
where the distortion goes down rapidly

95
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,012
from 1 to 2, and 2 to

96
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,033
3, and then you reach an

97
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:03,015
elbow at 3, and then

98
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,025
the distortion goes down very slowly after that.

99
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:06,052
And then it looks like, you

100
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:08,069
know what, maybe using three

101
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,091
clusters is the right

102
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,034
number of clusters, because that's

103
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,043
the elbow of this curve, right?

104
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,003
That it goes down, distortion goes

105
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,028
down rapidly until K equals

106
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:19,069
3, really goes down very slowly after that.

107
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:20,084
So let's pick K equals 3.

108
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:24,056
If you apply the Elbow Method,

109
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:26,024
and if you get a plot

110
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,044
that actually looks like this,

111
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:29,012
then, that's pretty good, and

112
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,015
this would be a reasonable way

113
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,059
of choosing the number of clusters.

114
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:34,059
It turns out the Elbow Method

115
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:37,016
isn't used that often, and one

116
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:38,027
reason is that, if you

117
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,046
actually use this on

118
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:41,006
a clustering problem, it turns out that

119
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,063
fairly often, you know,

120
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:43,061
you end up with a curve

121
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,093
that looks much more ambiguous, maybe something like this.

122
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,037
And if you look at this,

123
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:50,021
I don't know, maybe there's

124
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,058
no clear elbow, but it

125
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,009
looks like distortion continuously goes down,

126
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,056
maybe 3 is a

127
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:55,068
good number, maybe 4 is

128
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:58,018
a good number, maybe 5 is also not bad.

129
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,018
And so, if you actually

130
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,071
do this in a practice, you know,

131
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,068
if your plot looks like the one on the left and that's great.

132
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,099
It gives you a clear answer, but

133
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:06,055
just as often, you end

134
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,058
up with a plot that looks

135
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:09,002
like the one on the right and

136
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,000
is not clear where the

137
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:13,022
ready location of the elbow

138
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,043
is. It  makes it harder to

139
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:16,069
choose a number of clusters using this method.

140
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:18,022
So maybe the quick summary

141
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:20,050
of the Elbow Method is that is worth the shot

142
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,035
but I wouldn't necessarily,

143
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,069
you know, have a very high

144
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:27,036
expectation of it working for any particular problem.

145
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:31,002
Finally, here's one other way

146
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,085
of how, thinking about how

147
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,098
you choose the value of K,

148
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:36,002
very often people are running

149
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:37,037
K-means in order you

150
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:38,076
get clusters for some later

151
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,087
purpose, or for some sort of downstream purpose.

152
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,089
Maybe you want to use K-means

153
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,045
in order to do market segmentation,

154
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,060
like in the T-shirt sizing example that we talked about.

155
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:50,056
Maybe you want K-means to organize

156
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,030
a computer cluster better, or

157
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:53,043
maybe a learning cluster for some

158
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:55,006
different purpose, and so,

159
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,001
if that later, downstream purpose,

160
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,005
such as market segmentation. If

161
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:00,042
that gives you an evaluation metric,

162
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:02,067
then often, a better

163
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,088
way to determine the number of

164
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,068
clusters, is to see

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,074
how well different numbers of

166
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:10,013
clusters serve that later downstream purpose.

167
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:13,005
Let me step through a specific example.

168
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:15,007
Let me go through the T-shirt

169
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,042
size example again, and I'm

170
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:19,069
trying to decide, do I want three T-shirt sizes?

171
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,031
So, I choose K equals 3, then

172
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:25,036
I might have small, medium and large T-shirts.

173
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:27,025
Or maybe, I want to choose

174
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,024
K equals 5, and then I

175
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,013
might have, you know, extra

176
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,012
small, small, medium, large

177
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:35,006
and extra large T-shirt sizes.

178
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:38,057
So, you can have like 3 T-shirt sizes or four or five T-shirt sizes.

179
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:40,010
We could also have four T-shirt

180
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:41,074
sizes, but I'm just

181
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:43,024
showing three and five here,

182
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,067
just to simplify this slide for now.

183
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:49,001
So, if I run K-means with

184
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:50,029
K equals 3, maybe I end

185
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,086
up with, that's my small

186
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,001
and that's my

187
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,072
medium and that's my large.

188
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,037
Whereas, if I run K-means with

189
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:03,054
5 clusters, maybe I

190
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,017
end up with, those are

191
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,039
my extra small T-shirts, these

192
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,092
are my small, these are

193
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,074
my medium, these are my

194
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:17,011
large and these are my extra large.

195
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,014
And the nice thing about this

196
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,050
example is that, this then

197
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,093
maybe gives us another way

198
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:24,073
to choose whether we want

199
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,006
3 or 4 or 5 clusters,

200
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,062
and in particular, what you can

201
00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:30,062
do is, you know, think

202
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,076
about this from the perspective

203
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,081
of the T-shirt business and

204
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,014
ask: "Well if I have

205
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,018
five segments, then how well

206
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,061
will my T-shirts fit my

207
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:42,010
customers and so, how many T-shirts can I sell?

208
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,038
How happy will my customers be?"

209
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,092
What really makes sense, from the

210
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,052
perspective of the T-shirt business,

211
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,038
in terms of whether, I

212
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:51,048
want to have Goer T-shirt sizes

213
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:54,004
so that my T-shirts fit my customers better.

214
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:56,012
Or do I want to have fewer

215
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:57,056
T-shirt sizes so that

216
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,022
I make fewer sizes of T-shirts.

217
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:02,029
And I can sell them to the customers more cheaply.

218
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,069
And so, the t-shirt selling

219
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:06,014
business, that might give you

220
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:09,025
a way to decide, between three clusters versus five clusters.

221
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:12,000
So, that gives you an

222
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,087
example of how a

223
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:15,081
later downstream purpose like

224
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,025
the problem of deciding what

225
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,023
T-shirts to manufacture, how that

226
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,098
can give you an evaluation metric for choosing the number of clusters.

227
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,080
For those of you that are

228
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:25,049
doing the program exercises, if

229
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,006
you look at this week's

230
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,054
program exercise associative K-means, that's

231
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,000
an example there of using K-means for image compression.

232
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,095
And so if you were trying to

233
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:35,017
choose how many clusters

234
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,094
to use for that problem, you could

235
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,055
also, again use the

236
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:40,032
evaluation metric of image compression

237
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,047
to choose the number of clusters, K?

238
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:43,087
So, how good do you want the

239
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,043
image to look versus, how much

240
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,068
do you want to compress the file

241
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,038
size of the image, and,

242
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:49,082
you know, if you do the

243
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:50,098
programming exercise, what I've just

244
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:52,048
said will make more sense at that time.

245
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:56,050
So, just summarize, for the

246
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,080
most part, the number of

247
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:59,056
customers K is still chosen

248
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:01,089
by hand by human input or human insight.

249
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,081
One way to try to

250
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:05,000
do so is to use

251
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,036
the Elbow Method, but I

252
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,066
wouldn't always expect that to

253
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:08,062
work well, but I think

254
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:09,073
the better way to think about

255
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,080
how to choose the number of

256
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:12,031
clusters is to ask, for

257
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,088
what purpose are you running K-means?

258
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:16,061
And then to think, what is

259
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:18,020
the number of clusters K that

260
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:19,049
serves that, you know, whatever

261
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,070
later purpose that you actually run the K-means for.
