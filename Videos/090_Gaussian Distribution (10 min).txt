In this video, I'd like to
talk about the Gaussian distribution, which
is also called the normal distribution.
In case you're already intimately
familiar with the Gaussian distribution, it is
probably okay to skip this video.
But if you're not sure or
if it's been a while since you've
worked with a Gaussian distribution or the normal
distribution then please do
watch this video all the way to the end.
And in the video after this,
we'll start applying the Gaussian
distribution to developing an anomaly detection algorithm.
Let's say x is a
real value random variable, so x is a real number.
If the probability distribution of
x is Gaussian, it
would mean Mu and variant
sigma squared, then we'll
write this as x the
random variable tilde.
That's this little tilde
as distributed as and then
to denote the Gaussian Distribution, sometimes
you're going to write script n, parentheses
Mu, sigma squared.
So, this script's end stands for
normal, since Gaussian and normal
distribution, they mean the same
phase of synonymous and a
Gussian distribution is parameterized
by 2 parameters, by a
mean parameter which we
denote Mu, and a variance
parameter, which we denote by sigma squared.
If we pluck the Gaussian distribution
or Gaussian probability density, it
will look like the bell shaped
curve, which you may have seen before.
And so, this bell-shaped curve
is parameterized by those 2 parameters Mu and sigma.
And the location of the
center of this bell-shaped curve
is the mean Mu, and the
width of this bell-shaped curve,
so it's roughly that, is
the, this parameter
sigma, is also called one standard deviation.
And so, this specifies the
probability of x taking
on different values, so x
taking on values, you know
in the middle here is pretty high
since the Gaussian density here
is pretty high whereas
x taking on values further and
further away will be diminishing
in probability. Finally, just
for completeness, let me write
out the formula for the Gaussian
distribution so the property
of x and I'll
sometimes write this instead of
p of x, I'm going
to write this as p of
x semicolon Mu comma sigma squared.
And so this denotes that the probability of
x is parametrized by
the two parameters Mu and sigma squared.
And the formula for the
Gaussian density is this,
1 over 2pi, sigma e
to the negative x minus Mu squared over 2 sigma squared.
So there's no need to memorize this
formula, you know, this
is just the formula for the
bell-shaped curve over here on the left.
There's no need to memorize it and
if you ever need to use this,
you can always look this up.
And so that figure on the
left, that is what you get
if you take a fixed
value of Mu and a
fixed value of sigma and
you plot p of x. So this
curve here, this is really
p of x plotted as a
function of x, you know,
for a fixed value of Mu
and of sigma squared sigma squared, that's called the variance.
And sometimes it's easier to think in terms of sigma.
So sigma is called the
standard deviation and it,
so it specifies the
width of this Gaussian probability
density whereas the square
of sigma, so sigma squared, is
called the variance. Let's look
at some examples of what the Gaussian distribution looks like.
If Mu equals zero, sigma equals 1.
Then we have a Gaussian distribution
that is centered around zero, because that's Mu.
And the width of this Gaussian, so
that's one standard deviation is sigma over there.
Let's look at some examples of
Gaussians. If Mu
is equal to zero it equals 1.
Then that corresponds to a
Gaussian distribution that is centered
at zero since Mu is zero.
And the width of this Gaussian
is Gaussian thus controlled
by sigma by that variance parameter sigma.
Here's another example.
Let's say Mu is equal to
zero and sigma is equal to one-half.
So the standard deviation is
one-half and the variance
sigma squared would therefore be
the square of 0.5 would be 0.25.
And in that case the Gaussian distribution,
the Gaussian probability density looks
like this, is also centered at zero.
But now the width of
this is much smaller because
the smaller variance, the
width of this Gaussian density
is roughly half as wide.
But because this is a
probability distribution, the area under
the curve, that is the shaded
area there, that area
must integrate to 1.
This is a property of probability distributions.
And so, you know, this
is a much taller Gaussian density because
it's half as wide, with
half the standard deviation, but it's twice as tall.
Another example, if sigma is
equal to 2, then you
get a much fatter, or much wider Gaussian density.
And so here, the sigma
parameter controls that this
Gaussian density has a wider width.
And once again, the area under
the curve, that is this shaded
area, you know, it always integrates to 1.
That's a property of probability
distributions, and because it's
wider, it's also half as
tall, in order to just integrate to the same thing.
And finally, one last example would be,
if we now changed the Mu
parameters as well, then instead
of being centered at zero, we
now we have a Gaussian distribution
that is centered at three, because
this shifts over the entire Gaussian distribution.
Next, lets take about the parameter estimation problem.
So what is the parameter estimation problem?
Let's say we have a data set
of m examples, so x1
through x(m), and let's say
each of these examples is a real number.
Here in the figure, I've plotted an
example of a data set,
so the horizontal axis is the
x axis and, you know, I
have a range of examples of x and I've just plotted them
on this figure here.
And the parameter estimation problem is, let's
say I suspect that these examples
came from a Gaussian distribution so
let's say I suspect that each of my example x(i) was distributed.
That's what this tilde thing means.
Thus, I suspect that each of
these examples was distributed according
to a normal distribution or
Gaussian distribution with some
parameter Mu and some parameter sigma squared.
But I don't know what the values of these parameters are.
The problem with parameter estimation is,
given my data set I want
to figure out, I want to
estimate, what are the
values of Mu and sigma squared.
So, if you're given a
data set like this, you know,
it looks like maybe, if I
estimate what Gaussian distribution the
data came from, maybe that
might be roughly the Gaussian distribution
it came from, with Mu
being the center of the distribution and
sigma the standard deviation controlling the width of this Gaussian distribution.
It seems like a reasonable
fit to the data, because, you know, it
looks the data has
a very high probability of being
in the central region, low probability of
being further out, low probability of being further out, and so on.
And so, maybe this is
a reasonable estimate of
Mu and of sigma squared,
that is, if it corresponds to
a Gaussian distribution, that then looks like this.
So, what I'm going to
do is write out the
formulas, the standard formulas
for estimating the parameters from
Mu and sigma squared.
The way we are going to
estimate Mu is going to
be just the average
of my example.
So Mu is the mean parameter,
so I'm going to take my
training set, take my m
examples and average them.
And that just gives me the center of this distribution.
How about sigma squared?
Well the variance, I'll just
write out the standard formula again,
I'm going to estimate as sum
of 1 through m of x(i),
minus Mu squared,
and so this Mu here is
actually the Mu that I compute
over here using this formula,
and what the variance is, or
one interpretation of the variance,
is that, if you look at the
this term, that's the square
difference between the value
I've got in my example minus
the mean, minus the center, minus the mean of distribution.
And so, you know, the
variance, I'm gonna estimate
as just the average of
the square differences, between my examples, minus the mean.
And as a side comment,
only for those of you that are experts
in statistics, if you're
an expert in statistics and if
you've heard of maximum likelihood estimation,
then these estimates are actually the
maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters
of Mu and sigma squared.
But if you haven't heard of that before, don't worry about it.
All you need to know is that
these are the two standard formulas
for how you try to
figure out what our Mu and sigma squared given the dataset.
Finally one last side comment.
Again only for those of
you that has maybe taken a statistics class before.
But if you have taken a statistics
class before, some of you
may have seen the formula here
where, you know, this is m minus
1, instead of m. So
this first term becomes 1
over m minus 1, instead
of 1 over m. In machine
learning, people tend to use this 1 over m formula.
But in practice, whether it
is 1 over m or 1
over m minus one, makes essentially
no difference, assuming, you know, m is
reasonably large, it's a large training set size.
So, just in case you've seen
this other version before, in either
version it works just equally
well, but in machine
learning most people tend to
use 1 over m in this formula.
And the two versions have slightly
different theoretical properties, slightly different
mathematical properties, but in
practice it really makes very little difference, if any.
So, hopefully, you now have
a good sense of what the
Gaussian distribution looks like,
as well as how to estimate
the parameters, mu and sigma
squared, of the Gaussian distribution, and
if you're given a training set,
that is if you're given a
set of data that you suspect
comes from a Gaussian
distribution with unknown parameters using sigma squared.
In the next video, we'll start
to take this and apply it
to develop the anomaly detection algorithm.
