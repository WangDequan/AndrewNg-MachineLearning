1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,055
In this and the next video,

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:03,047
I'd like to tell you about one

3
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:05,087
possible extension to the

4
00:00:06,013 --> 00:00:08,026
anomaly detection algorithm that we've developed so far.

5
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,097
This extension uses something called the multivariate

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:13,048
Gaussian distribution, and it

7
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:14,097
has some advantages, and some

8
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,078
disadvantages, and it can

9
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,060
sometimes catch some anomalies that the earlier algorithm didn't.

10
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:23,073
To motivate this, let's start with an example.

11
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:28,041
Let's say that so our unlabeled data looks like what I have plotted here.

12
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,019
And I'm going to use

13
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:32,032
the example of monitoring machines

14
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:34,089
in the data center, monitoring computers in the data center.

15
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,017
So my two features are x1

16
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:37,007
which is the CPU load and x2

17
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:39,028
which is maybe the memory use.

18
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:42,015
So if I take

19
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:43,032
my two features, x1 and x2,

20
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:45,096
and I model them as Gaussians then

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,042
here's a plot of

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,003
my X1 features, here's a

23
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,036
plot of my X2 features,

24
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,088
and so if I fit a

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,064
Gaussian to that, maybe I'll

26
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:56,004
get a Gaussian like this, so

27
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:57,075
here's P of X 1,

28
00:00:57,085 --> 00:01:00,035
which depends

29
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:02,013
on the parameters mu 1, and

30
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:04,073
sigma squared 1,

31
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:06,012
and here's my memory used, and,

32
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:07,001
you know, maybe I'll get a Gaussian

33
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:09,090
that looks like this, and this is my P of X 2,

34
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:12,050
which depends on mu 2 and sigma squared 2.

35
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:14,065
And so this is

36
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:16,034
how the anomaly detection algorithm

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,084
models X1 and X2.

38
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,015
Now let's say that in the

39
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,032
test sets I have an

40
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,001
example that looks like this.

41
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,059
The location of that green

42
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:29,015
cross, so the value of

43
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,021
X 1 is about 0.4, and the value of X 2 is about 1.5.

44
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:34,043
Now, if you look at

45
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:35,078
the data, it looks like,

46
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,078
yeah, most of the data data

47
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,079
lies in this region, and

48
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:40,040
so that green cross

49
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,051
is pretty far away from any of the data I've seen.

50
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,087
It looks like that should be raised

51
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,079
as an anomaly. So, in my

52
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:48,065
data, in my, in the

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,093
data of my good examples,

54
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,043
it looks like, you know, the

55
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,068
CPU load, and the

56
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,032
memory use, they sort

57
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:56,009
of grow linearly with each other.

58
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:57,071
So if I have a

59
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:59,000
machine using lots of CPU,

60
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:00,045
you know memory use

61
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:02,093
will also be high, whereas this

62
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,090
example, this green example it looks like

63
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:07,014
here, the CPU load is

64
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,028
very low, but the memory use

65
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:09,031
is very high, and I just

66
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:10,081
have not seen that before in my training set.

67
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,015
It looks like that should be an anomaly.

68
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:15,030
But let's see what the anomaly detection algorithm will do.

69
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:16,075
Well, for the CPU load, it

70
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:17,099
puts it at around there

71
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:20,069
0.5 and this reasonably high

72
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,090
probability is not that

73
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:23,034
far from other examples we've seen,

74
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,022
maybe, whereas, for the

75
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:28,031
memory use, this appointment, 0.5,

76
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:29,090
whereas for the memory

77
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:32,034
use, it's about 1.5, which is there. Again,

78
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,059
you know, it's all to

79
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,084
us, it's not terribly Gaussian, but

80
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,031
the value here and the value

81
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,083
here is not that different

82
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:41,018
from many other examples we've

83
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,002
seen, and so P of

84
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,053
X 1, will be pretty high,

85
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:46,003
reasonably high.

86
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:47,072
P of X 2 reasonably high.

87
00:02:47,097 --> 00:02:49,003
I mean, if you look at this

88
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,022
plot right, this point here,

89
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,053
it doesn't look that bad, and

90
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,043
if you look at this plot, you

91
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,068
know across here, doesn't look that bad.

92
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,078
I mean, I have had examples with

93
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:00,072
even greater memory used, or

94
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:02,027
with even less CPU use,

95
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:04,078
and so this example doesn't look that anomalous.

96
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,037
And so, an anomaly detection algorithm

97
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:10,009
will fail to flag this point as an anomaly.

98
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:12,021
And it turns out what

99
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,061
our anomaly detection algorithm is

100
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:15,006
doing is that it is

101
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,069
not realizing that this blue

102
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,006
ellipse shows the high

103
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:19,037
probability region, is that, one

104
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,028
of the thing is that, examples here,

105
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:23,043
a high probability, and the

106
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,097
examples, the next circle

107
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:27,028
of from a lower probably, and

108
00:03:27,037 --> 00:03:28,094
examples here are even

109
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,003
lower probability, and somehow, here

110
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,006
are things that are, green cross

111
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,043
there, it's pretty high probability,

112
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,050
and in particular, it tends to think

113
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,074
that, you know, everything in this

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,040
region, everything on the

115
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:43,038
line that I'm circling over, has, you know, about equal probability,

116
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,081
and it doesn't realize that something

117
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:50,090
out here actually has

118
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:53,012
much lower probability than something over there.

119
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,008
So, in order to fix

120
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,030
this, we can, we're going to

121
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:58,093
develop a modified version of

122
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,003
the anomaly detection algorithm, using

123
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:02,052
something called the multivariate

124
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:05,087
Gaussian distribution also called the multivariate normal distribution.

125
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,012
So here's what we're going to

126
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,027
do. We have features x

127
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,068
which are in Rn and

128
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,018
instead of P of X 1, P of X 2, separately,

129
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:15,062
we're going to model P of

130
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,083
X, all in one go,

131
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,097
so model P of X, you know, all at the same time.

132
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,055
So the parameters of the

133
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:24,013
multivariate Gaussian distribution are mu,

134
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,076
which is a vector, and sigma,

135
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,044
which is an n by n matrix, called a covariance matrix,

136
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:30,087
and this is similar to the

137
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,022
covariance matrix that we

138
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:33,056
saw when we were working

139
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,019
with the PCA, with the

140
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,069
principal components analysis algorithm.

141
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,097
For the second complete is, let

142
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:39,087
me just write out the formula

143
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,038
for the multivariate Gaussian distribution.

144
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,002
So we say that probability of

145
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,010
X, and this is parameterized

146
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:47,050
by my parameters mu and

147
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:49,027
sigma that the

148
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:50,010
probability of x is equal

149
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,025
to once again

150
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:54,081
there's absolutely no need to memorize this formula.

151
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:56,077
You know, you can look it up

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,016
whenever you need to use

153
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,012
it, but this is what

154
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:01,023
the probability of X looks like.

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,068
Transverse, 2nd inverse, X

156
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:06,030
minus mu.

157
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,085
And this thing here,

158
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,050
the absolute value of sigma, this

159
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:13,013
thing here when you write

160
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,043
this symbol, this is called

161
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,022
the determent of sigma

162
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:19,062
and this is a mathematical function

163
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,074
of a matrix and you really

164
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:22,081
don't need to know what the

165
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,025
determinant of a matrix is,

166
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:25,076
but really all you need to

167
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:27,018
know is that you can

168
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:29,037
compute it in octave by using

169
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,081
the octave command DET of

170
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:33,056
sigma.

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,020
Okay, and again, just be clear, alright?

172
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,024
In this expression, these sigmas

173
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:41,025
here, these are just n by n matrix.

174
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:43,014
This is not a summation and

175
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:45,068
you know, the sigma there is an n by n matrix.

176
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,077
So that's the formula for P

177
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,050
of X, but it's

178
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,002
more interestingly, or more importantly,

179
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:55,061
what does P of X actually looks like?

180
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,044
Lets look at some examples of

181
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:00,068
multivariate Gaussian distributions.

182
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:03,037
So let's take a

183
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,069
two dimensional example, say if

184
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,055
I have N equals 2, I

185
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,016
have two features, X 1 and X 2.

186
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,054
Lets say I set MU to

187
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:11,080
be equal to 0 and sigma

188
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:14,002
to be equal to this matrix here.

189
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:16,070
With 1s on the diagonals and 0s on the off-diagonals,

190
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,098
this matrix is sometimes also called the identity matrix.

191
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,047
In that case, p of

192
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:24,094
x will look like

193
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:27,043
this, and what

194
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,037
I'm showing in this figure is, you know,

195
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,089
for a specific value of X1

196
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,086
and for a specific value of

197
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:34,068
X2, the height of

198
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,047
this surface the value

199
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:38,032
of p of x. And

200
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,051
so with this setting the parameters

201
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:42,010
p of x is highest when

202
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,062
X1 and X2 equal zero 0,

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,070
so that's the peak of this Gaussian distribution,

204
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:48,075
and the probability falls off with this

205
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:51,032
sort of two dimensional Gaussian or

206
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,058
this bell shaped two dimensional bell-shaped surface.

207
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,039
Down below is the same

208
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,023
thing but plotted using a

209
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:00,097
contour plot instead, or using different colors,

210
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:02,001
and so this

211
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:04,020
heavy intense red in the

212
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:06,025
middle, corresponds to the highest values,

213
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:08,023
and then the values decrease

214
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,047
with the yellow being slightly lower

215
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,082
values the cyan being

216
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:13,023
lower values and this deep

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,043
blue being the lowest

218
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:17,000
values so this is really the same figure but plotted

219
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:19,041
viewed from the top instead, using colors instead.

220
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:22,050
And so, with this distribution,

221
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:25,000
you see that it faces most

222
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,043
of the probability near 0,0

223
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,062
and then as you go out

224
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,044
from 0,0 the probability of X1 and X2 goes down.

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,022
Now lets try varying some

226
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:38,062
of the parameters and see

227
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:40,014
what happens. So let's

228
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,042
take sigma and change it

229
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:44,072
so let's say sigma shrinks a

230
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,035
little bit. Sigma is a

231
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:47,070
covariance matrix and so it

232
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:49,002
measures the variance or the

233
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,063
variability of the features X1 X2.

234
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:52,007
So if the shrink

235
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,043
sigma then what you get

236
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:54,029
is what you get is that the

237
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,031
width of this bump diminishes

238
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,031
and the height also

239
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,062
increases a bit, because the

240
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,007
area under the surface is equal to 1.

241
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,039
So the integral of the

242
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:06,023
volume under the surface is

243
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:08,000
equal to 1, because probability

244
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:10,007
distribution must integrate to one.

245
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,064
But, if you shrink the variance,

246
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,029
it's kinda like shrinking

247
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,087
sigma squared,

248
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:20,007
you end up with a narrower distribution, and one that's a little bit taller.

249
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,014
And so you see here also the

250
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:27,019
concentric ellipsis has shrunk a little bit.

251
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,073
Whereas in contrast if you were to increase sigma

252
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,000
to 2 2 on the

253
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,001
diagonals, so it is now two

254
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,037
times the identity then you end up with a

255
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,087
much wider and much flatter Gaussian.

256
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:38,019
And so the width of this is much wider.

257
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:39,079
This is hard to see but this

258
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,009
is still a bell shaped bump,

259
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,053
it's just flattened down a lot,

260
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:44,047
it has become much wider and

261
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,072
so the variance or the

262
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,069
variability of X1 and X2 just becomes wider.

263
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:50,098
Here are a few more examples.

264
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:53,092
Now lets try varying

265
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,049
one of the elements of sigma at the time.

266
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:58,008
Let's say I send sigma to

267
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:00,001
0.6 there, and 1 over there.

268
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,037
What this does, is this

269
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,024
reduces the variance of

270
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,096
the first feature, X 1, while

271
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:08,088
keeping the variance of the

272
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:11,052
second feature X 2, the same.

273
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:15,014
And so with this setting of parameters, you can model things like that.

274
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,090
X 1 has smaller variance, and

275
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,012
X 2 has larger variance.

276
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:20,079
Whereas if I do this,

277
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:22,089
if I set this

278
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,038
matrix to 2, 1

279
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:25,089
then you can also model

280
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,047
examples where you know here

281
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,059
we'll say X1 can have take

282
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,092
on a large range of values

283
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,087
whereas X2 takes on a relatively narrower range of values.

284
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,005
And that's reflected in this

285
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,003
figure as well, you know where,

286
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:40,052
the distribution falls off

287
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,066
more slowly as X 1

288
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,094
moves away from 0,

289
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,037
and falls off very

290
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:48,008
rapidly as X 2 moves away from 0.

291
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,071
And similarly if

292
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,032
we were to modify

293
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,049
this element of the

294
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:55,057
matrix instead, then similar to the previous

295
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,086
slide, except that here where

296
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,089
you know playing around here saying

297
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:03,000
that X2 can take on

298
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,046
a very small range of values

299
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,084
and so here if this

300
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,074
is 0.6, we notice now X2

301
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,061
tends to take on a much

302
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:12,092
smaller range of values than the original example,

303
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,030
whereas if we were to

304
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,032
set sigma to be equal to 2 then

305
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,058
that's like saying X2 you know, has a much larger range of values.

306
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:23,057
Now, one of the cool

307
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,095
things about the multivariate

308
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,069
Gaussian distribution is that

309
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:28,004
you can also use it to

310
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,023
model correlations between the data.

311
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,092
That is we can use it to

312
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,050
model the fact that

313
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,094
X1 and X2 tend to be

314
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:36,075
highly correlated with each other for example.

315
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:38,087
So specifically if you start

316
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,072
to change the off diagonal

317
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,038
entries of this covariance

318
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:45,025
matrix you can get a different type of Gaussian distribution.

319
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:48,025
And so as I

320
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:49,059
increase the off-diagonal entries

321
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,029
from .5 to .8, what

322
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:53,008
I get is this distribution that

323
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:54,059
is more and more thinly peaked

324
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,048
along this sort of x equals y line.

325
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,010
And so here the

326
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:00,061
contour says that x and

327
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:03,000
y tend to grow together and

328
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,050
the things that are with

329
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,054
large probability are if

330
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,013
either X1 is large and

331
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:09,055
Y2 is large or X1

332
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:11,015
is small and Y2 is small.

333
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,048
Or somewhere in between.

334
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,070
And as this entry,

335
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:16,027
0.8 gets large, you get

336
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,040
a Gaussian distribution, that's sort of

337
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:20,057
where all the probability lies on

338
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:22,087
this sort of narrow region,

339
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:26,020
where x is approximately equal to

340
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,052
y. This is a very

341
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:30,028
tall, thin distribution you know

342
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,057
line mostly along this line

343
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:34,094
central region where x is

344
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,086
close to y. So this

345
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,035
is if we set these

346
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,036
entries to be positive entries.

347
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:42,012
In contrast if we set

348
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:43,052
these to negative values, as

349
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,034
I decreases it to -.5

350
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,091
down to -.8, then

351
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,036
what we get is a model where

352
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:50,092
we put most of the probability

353
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:53,092
in this sort of negative X

354
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,041
one in the next 2 correlation region,

355
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:57,033
and so, most of the

356
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,041
probability now lies in this region,

357
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,090
where X 1 is about equal

358
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,070
to -X 2, rather than X

359
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,037
1 equals X 2.

360
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:05,046
And so this captures a sort

361
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:08,004
of negative correlation between x1

362
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:10,064
and x2.

363
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,054
And so this is

364
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:13,063
a hopefully this gives you a sense of the

365
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:15,023
different distributions that the

366
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:17,039
multivariate Gaussian distribution can capture.

367
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,042
So follow up in varying, the

368
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,020
covariance matrix sigma, the other

369
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,087
thing you can do is

370
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:26,009
also, vary the mean

371
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,073
parameter mu, and so

372
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:29,074
operationally, we have mu

373
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:31,019
equal 0 0, and so the

374
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:32,082
distribution was centered around

375
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:34,064
X 1 equals 0, X2 equals 0,

376
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,098
so the peak of the

377
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:38,052
distribution is here, whereas,

378
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:40,042
if we vary the values of

379
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:42,012
mu, then that varies the

380
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,070
peak of the distribution and so,

381
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,076
if mu equals 0, 0.5,

382
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,010
the peak is at, you know,

383
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:49,047
X1 equals zero, and X2

384
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,042
equals 0.5, and so the

385
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:53,039
peak or the center of

386
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,025
this distribution has shifted,

387
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:57,076
and if mu was 1.5

388
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,004
minus 0.5 then OK,

389
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:03,035
and similarly the peak

390
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:05,049
of the distribution has now

391
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:06,075
shifted to a different location,

392
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,071
corresponding to where, you know,

393
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,001
X1 is 1.5 and X2

394
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,071
is -0.5, and so

395
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:15,017
varying the mu parameter, just shifts

396
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:17,084
around the center of this whole distribution.

397
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:19,066
So, hopefully, looking at

398
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:21,026
all these different pictures gives you

399
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,044
a sense of the sort

400
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,085
of probability distributions that

401
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:28,000
the Multivariate Gaussian Distribution allows you to capture.

402
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,079
And the key advantage of it

403
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,092
is it allows you to

404
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,024
capture, when you'd expect

405
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:33,084
two different features to be

406
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:36,055
positively correlated, or maybe negatively correlated.

407
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:39,002
In the next video, we'll take

408
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,075
this multivariate Gaussian distribution

409
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,028
and apply it to anomaly detection.
