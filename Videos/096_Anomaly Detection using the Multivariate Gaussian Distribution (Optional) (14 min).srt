00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,041
In the last video we talked

2
00:00:01,075 --> 00:00:03,050
about the Multivariate Gaussian Distribution

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,099
and saw some examples of the

4
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,083
sorts of distributions you can model, as

5
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:10,088
you vary the parameters, mu and sigma.

6
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,018
In this video, let's take those

7
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,068
ideas, and apply them

8
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:17,055
to develop a different anomaly detection algorithm.

9
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:21,089
To recap the multivariate Gaussian

10
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:23,007
distribution and the multivariate normal

11
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:26,064
distribution has two parameters, mu and sigma.

12
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:28,085
Where mu this an n

13
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:31,010
dimensional vector and sigma,

14
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,042
the covariance matrix, is an

15
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:36,010
n by n matrix.

16
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:38,071
And here's the formula for

17
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,078
the probability of X, as

18
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:41,086
parameterized by mu and

19
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:43,077
sigma, and as you

20
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:45,000
vary mu and sigma, you

21
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:45,082
can get a range of different

22
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:47,070
distributions, like, you know,

23
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:48,099
these are three examples of the

24
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,065
ones that we saw in the previous video.

25
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,010
So let's talk about the

26
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:54,060
parameter fitting or the

27
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,025
parameter estimation problem. The

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,047
question, as usual, is if

29
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,089
I have a set of examples

30
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,014
X1 through XM and here each

31
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,075
of these examples is an

32
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:05,081
n dimensional vector and I think my

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,028
examples come from a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

34
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:12,045
How do I try to estimate my parameters mu and sigma?

35
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:15,006
Well the standard formulas for

36
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:17,017
estimating them is you

37
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:18,026
set mu to be just

38
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,095
the average of your training examples.

39
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,076
And you set sigma to be equal to this.

40
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,012
And this is actually just

41
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,020
like the sigma that we had

42
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:26,085
written out, when we were

43
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,073
using the PCA or

44
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:30,075
the Principal Components Analysis algorithm.

45
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,073
So you just plug in these

46
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,029
two formulas and this

47
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:36,071
would give you your estimated parameter

48
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,043
mu and your estimated parameter sigma.

49
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,085
So given the data set here is how you estimate mu and sigma.

50
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:45,034
Let's take this method

51
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,040
and just plug it

52
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,012
into an anomaly detection algorithm.

53
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:51,001
So how do we

54
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,020
put all of this together to

55
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:54,015
develop an anomaly detection algorithm?

56
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:55,078
Here 's what we do.

57
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:57,048
First we take our training

58
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,010
set, and we fit the

59
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,020
model, we fit P

60
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,064
of X, by, you know, setting

61
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:02,071
mu and sigma as described

62
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:05,040
on the previous slide.

63
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:08,050
Next when you are given

64
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:10,016
a new example X. So

65
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,043
if you are given a test example,

66
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:15,024
lets take an earlier example to have a new example out here.

67
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:16,078
And that is my test example.

68
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,066
Given the new example X, what

69
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,021
we are going to do is compute

70
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:23,041
P of X, using this

71
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:26,025
formula for the multivariate Gaussian distribution.

72
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:29,021
And then, if P of

73
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:30,084
X is very small, then we

74
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:31,080
flagged it as an anomaly,

75
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,056
whereas, if P of X is greater

76
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:35,052
than that parameter epsilon, then

77
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:39,018
we don't flag it as an anomaly.

78
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,024
So it turns out, if we were to fit a multivariate Gaussian distribution to this data set,

79
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,021
so just the red crosses, not the green example,

80
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:46,009
you end up with a Gaussian

81
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,008
distribution that places lots

82
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,068
of probability in the central

83
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,084
region, slightly less probability here,

84
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:53,036
slightly less probability here,

85
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,000
slightly less probability here,

86
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:59,028
and very low probability at the point that is way out here.

87
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,034
And so, if you apply

88
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:04,072
the multivariate Gaussian distribution to

89
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,053
this example, it will actually

90
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,061
correctly flag that example.

91
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:09,091
as an anomaly.

92
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:18,008
Finally it's worth saying

93
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:19,063
a few words about what is

94
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,090
the relationship between the

95
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:23,081
multivariate Gaussian distribution model, and

96
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,043
the original model, where we

97
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,087
were modeling P of

98
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:28,000
X as a product of this

99
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:28,088
P of X1, P of X2,

100
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:31,041
up to P of Xn.

101
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:33,088
It turns out that you can

102
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,031
prove mathematically, I'm not

103
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:36,046
going to do the proof here, but

104
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,012
you can prove mathematically that this

105
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,061
relationship, between the

106
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:42,024
multivariate Gaussian model and

107
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,003
this original one. And in

108
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:45,041
particular, it turns out

109
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,050
that the original model corresponds

110
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:50,033
to multivariate Gaussians, where

111
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,097
the contours of the

112
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:54,006
Gaussian are always axis aligned.

113
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,034
So all three of

114
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:59,038
these are examples of

115
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,030
Gaussian distributions that you

116
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:02,093
can fit using the original model.

117
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:04,009
It turns out that that corresponds

118
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:06,091
to multivariate Gaussian, where, you

119
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,083
know, the ellipsis here, the contours

120
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:13,059
of this distribution--it

121
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,018
turns out that this model actually

122
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,002
corresponds to a special

123
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,016
case of a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

124
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:21,011
And in particular, this special

125
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,093
case is defined by constraining

126
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:25,070
the distribution of p

127
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,011
of x, the multivariate a Gaussian

128
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,006
distribution of p of x,

129
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,074
so that the contours of

130
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,033
the probability density function, of

131
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:35,000
the probability distribution function, are axis aligned.

132
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,039
And so you can get a p

133
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:39,055
of x with a

134
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,043
multivariate Gaussian that looks like

135
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:43,085
this, or like this, or like this.

136
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:44,099
And you notice, that in all

137
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,081
3 of these examples, these ellipses,

138
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,049
or these ovals that I'm drawing, have

139
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:53,018
their axes aligned with the X1 X2 axes.

140
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,092
And what we do not have, is

141
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,031
a set of contours

142
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,044
that are at an angle, right?

143
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,062
And this corresponded to examples where

144
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,077
sigma is equal to 1 1, 0.8, 0.8.

145
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,079
Let's say, with non-0 elements on the

146
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,077
off diagonals.

147
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:11,097
So, it turns out that

148
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:13,098
it's possible to show mathematically that

149
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:16,039
this model actually is the

150
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:18,030
same as a multivariate Gaussian

151
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,056
distribution but with a constraint.

152
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:24,039
And the constraint is that the

153
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:26,070
covariance matrix sigma must

154
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:28,089
have 0's on the off diagonal elements.

155
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:30,082
In particular, the covariance matrix sigma,

156
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,044
this thing here, it would

157
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,093
be sigma squared 1, sigma

158
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,005
squared 2, down to sigma

159
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,066
squared n, and then

160
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,055
everything on the off diagonal

161
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,020
entries, all of these elements

162
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:45,011
above and below the diagonal of the matrix,

163
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:46,085
all of those are going to be zero.

164
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,037
And in fact if you take

165
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:50,098
these values of sigma, sigma

166
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:52,027
squared 1, sigma squared 2,

167
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,037
down to sigma squared n,

168
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:56,037
and plug them into here, and

169
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,063
you know, plug them into this

170
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:59,057
covariance matrix, then the

171
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,012
two models are actually identical.

172
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:02,056
That is, this new model,

173
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,052
using a multivariate Gaussian distribution,

174
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,033
corresponds exactly to the

175
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,050
old model, if the covariance

176
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,069
matrix sigma, has only

177
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,049
0 elements off the diagonals,

178
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,069
and in pictures that

179
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:19,056
corresponds to having Gaussian distributions,

180
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:22,025
where the contours of this

181
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:25,062
distribution function are axis aligned.

182
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,050
So you aren't allowed to model the correlations between the diffrent features.

183
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,051
So in that sense the original model

184
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,083
is actually a special case of this multivariate Gaussian model.

185
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:40,037
So when would you use each of these two models?

186
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:41,075
So when would you the original

187
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:42,087
model and when would you use

188
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:45,017
the multivariate Gaussian model?

189
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,067
The original model is probably

190
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,083
used somewhat more often,

191
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,016
and whereas the multivariate Gaussian

192
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:04,047
distribution is used somewhat

193
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,067
less but it has the advantage of being

194
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,029
able to capture correlations between features. So

195
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:11,060
suppose you want to

196
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:13,010
capture anomalies where you

197
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,043
have different features say where

198
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,056
features x1, x2 take

199
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,075
on unusual combinations of values

200
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,031
so in the earlier

201
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:27,031
example, we had that example where the anomaly was with the CPU load and the memory use taking on unusual combinations of values, if

202
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:31,022
you want to use the original

203
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,050
model to capture that, then what you

204
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:34,064
need to do is create an

205
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,077
extra feature, such as X3

206
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:40,070
equals X1/X2, you know

207
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:46,048
equals maybe the CPU load divided by the memory used, or something, and you

208
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,002
need to create extra features

209
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,043
if there's unusual combinations of values

210
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,093
where X1 and X2 take

211
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,089
on an unusual combination of

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,036
values even though X1 by

213
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:58,061
itself and X2 by itself

214
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:03,052
looks like it's taking a perfectly normal value. But if you're willing to spend the time to manually

215
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:05,024
create an extra feature like this,

216
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:07,067
then the original model will work

217
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:14,017
fine. 
Whereas in contrast, the multivariate Gaussian model can automatically capture

218
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:23,036
correlations between different features. But the original model has some other more significant advantages, too, and one huge

219
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:24,099
advantage of the original model

220
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,039
is that it is computationally cheaper, and another view on this

221
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:31,017
is that is scales better to

222
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,072
very large values of n

223
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,026
and very large numbers of

224
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,025
features, and so even

225
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,009
if n were ten thousand,

226
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:40,035
or even if n were equal

227
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,060
to a hundred thousand, the original

228
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:47,012
model will usually work just fine.

229
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,092
Whereas in contrast for the multivariate Gaussian model notice here, for

230
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:49,094
example, that we need to

231
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:51,073
compute the inverse of the matrix

232
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,075
sigma where sigma is

233
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,023
an n by n matrix

234
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,083
and so computing sigma if

235
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,095
sigma is a hundred thousand by a

236
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,090
hundred thousand matrix that is going to be very computationally expensive.

237
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,064
And so the multivariate Gaussian model

238
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:06,089
scales less well to large

239
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,021
values of N. And

240
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,002
finally for the original

241
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,062
model, it turns out

242
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,085
to work out ok even if

243
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,051
you have a relatively small training

244
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,000
set this is the small unlabeled

245
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,012
examples that we use to model p of x

246
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,060
of course, and this works fine, even if

247
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:23,039
M is, you

248
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,014
know, maybe 50, 100, works fine.

249
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,074
Whereas for the multivariate Gaussian, it

250
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,034
is sort of a mathematical property

251
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:31,023
of the algorithm that you must have m

252
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:38,080
greater than n, so that the number of examples is greater than the number of features you have. And there's a mathematical property of the way we estimate the parameters

253
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:43,085
that if this is not true, so if m is less than or equal to n,

254
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:51,061
then this matrix isn't even invertible, that is this matrix is singular, and so you can't even use the

255
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,023
multivariate Gaussian model unless you make some changes to it. But a

256
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,082
typical rule of thumb

257
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:58,075
that I use is, I will use the

258
00:09:58,086 --> 00:10:00,050
multivariate Gaussian model only if m is much greater than n, so this is sort of the

259
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,075
narrow mathematical requirement, but

260
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:07,029
in practice, I would use

261
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,090
the multivariate Gaussian model, only

262
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,041
if m were quite a bit

263
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:11,087
bigger than n. 
So if

264
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,032
m were greater than or

265
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,077
equal to 10 times n, let's

266
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:16,046
say, might be a reasonable rule of thumb, and if

267
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,088
it doesn't satisfy this, then the multivariate Gaussian model

268
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,032
has a lot

269
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,085
of parameters, right, so this covariance matrix sigma is an n by n matrix,

270
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,059
so it has, you know, roughly

271
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:31,023
n squared parameters, because it's a symmetric matrix,

272
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,003
it's actually closer to n squared

273
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,023
over 2 parameters, but this is a

274
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,022
lot of parameters, so you need

275
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,072
make sure you have a fairly

276
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:48,035
large value for m, make sure you have enough data to fit all these parameters. And m greater than

277
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,022
or equal to 10 n would be a reasonable rule of thumb to make sure that you can estimate this covariance matrix sigma reasonably well.

278
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:56,024
So in practice the original

279
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:58,094
model shown on the left that is used more often.

280
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,084
And if you suspect that you

281
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:02,067
need to capture correlations between features

282
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:08,014
what people will often do is just manually design extra features like these to capture specific

283
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:13,001
unusual combinations of values. But in problems where you

284
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,030
have a very large training set or m is very large and n is

285
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,015
not too large, then the multivariate Gaussian

286
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:21,072
model is well worth considering and may work better as well, and can

287
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:25,096
save you from having to

288
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,039
spend your time to manually

289
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,035
create extra features in case

290
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:33,051
the anomalies turn out to be captured by unusual

291
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,078
combinations of values of the features.

292
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:38,033
Finally I just want to

293
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,022
briefly mention one somewhat technical

294
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:42,020
property, but if you're

295
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:43,021
fitting multivariate Gaussian

296
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,059
model, and if you find

297
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,034
that the covariance matrix sigma

298
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:48,015
is singular, or you find

299
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:51,034
it's non-invertible, they're usually 2 cases for this.

300
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,099
One is if it's failing to

301
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,026
satisfy this m greater than

302
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,020
n condition, and the

303
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,097
second case is if you have redundant features.

304
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:00,098
So by redundant features, I mean,

305
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:02,075
if you have 2 features that are the same.

306
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:04,070
Somehow you accidentally made two

307
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:11,022
copies of the feature, so your x1 is just equal to x2. Or if you have redundant features like maybe

308
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:14,091
your features X3 is equal to feature X4, plus feature X5.

309
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,096
Okay, so if you have highly

310
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:18,050
redundant features like these, you

311
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,011
know, where if X3 is equal

312
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:21,084
to X4 plus X5, well X3

313
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,041
doesn't contain any extra information, right?

314
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,046
You just take these 2 other features, and add them together.

315
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:28,089
And if you have this

316
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,096
sort of redundant features, duplicated features,

317
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,002
or this sort of features, than sigma may be non-invertible.

318
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,000
And so there's a debugging set--

319
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:38,026
this should very rarely happen,

320
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,019
so you probably won't run into this,

321
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,077
it is very unlikely that you have to worry about this--

322
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,048
but in case you implement a

323
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:46,085
multivariate Gaussian model you find that sigma is non-invertible.

324
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,035
What I would do is first

325
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,029
make sure that M is quite

326
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,051
a bit bigger than N, and if it

327
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,063
is then, the second thing I

328
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,055
do, is just check for redundant features.

329
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,007
And so if there are 2 features

330
00:12:58,014 --> 00:12:59,036
that are equal, just get rid

331
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:00,059
of one of them, or if

332
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,058
you have redundant if these

333
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,010
, X3 equals X4 plus X5,

334
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,015
just get rid of the redundant

335
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:08,064
feature, and then it should work fine again.

336
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:09,061
As an aside for those of you

337
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:11,021
who are experts in linear algebra,

338
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,027
by redundant features, what I

339
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,097
mean is the formal term is

340
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,067
features that are linearly dependent.

341
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,017
But in practice what that really means

342
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:21,071
is one of these problems tripping

343
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:24,012
up the algorithm if you just make you features non-redundant.,

344
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,038
that should solve the problem of sigma being non-invertable.

345
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,010
But once again

346
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:30,062
the odds of your running into this

347
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:32,019
at all are pretty low so

348
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:33,079
chances are, you can

349
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,046
just apply the multivariate Gaussian

350
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:37,024
model, without having to

351
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,014
worry about sigma being non-invertible,

352
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,017
so long as m is greater

353
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:42,077
than or equal to n.
So

354
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,017
that's it for anomaly detection,

355
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,023
with the multivariate Gaussian distribution.

356
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:49,024
And if you apply this method

357
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,015
you would be able to have an

358
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,025
anomaly detection algorithm that automatically

359
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,042
captures positive and negative

360
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,069
correlations between your different

361
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,051
features and flags an anomaly

362
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,082
if it sees is unusual combination

363
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:02,076
of the values of the features.
