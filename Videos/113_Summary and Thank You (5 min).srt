00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,084
Welcome to the final video of this Machine Learning class.

2
00:00:03,084 --> 00:00:06,047
We've been through a lot of different videos together.

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,077
In this video I would like to just quickly

4
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:11,000
summarize the main topics of this course

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,008
and then say a few words at the end and that

6
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,072
will wrap up the class.

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,001
So what have we done?

8
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,095
In this class we spent a lot of time talking about supervised learning algorithms

9
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:25,043
like linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, SVMs.

10
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:29,043
for problems where you have labelled data and labelled examples

11
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:31,029
like x(i), y(i)

12
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:35,071
And we also spent quite a lot of time talking about unsupervised learning

13
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:37,034
like K-means clustering,

14
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:40,031
Principal Components Analysis for dimensionality reduction

15
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:43,084
and Anomaly Detection algorithms for when you have only

16
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,036
unlabelled data x(i)

17
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:49,037
Although Anomaly Detection can also use some labelled data

18
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:51,018
to evaluate the algorithm.

19
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:54,072
We also spent some time talking about special applications

20
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:56,040
or special topics like Recommender Systems

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,089
and large scale machine learning systems

22
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,047
including parallelized and rapid-use systems

23
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,092
as well as some special applications like

24
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:07,060
sliding windows object classification for computer vision.

25
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,054
And finally we also spent a lot of time talking about different aspects

26
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:15,019
of, sort of, advice on building a machine learning system.

27
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:17,026
And this involved both trying to understand

28
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:19,023
what is it that makes a machine learning algorithm

29
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:20,056
work or not work.

30
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:22,001
So we talked about things like bias and variance,

31
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:25,047
and how regularization can help with some variance problems.

32
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:28,044
And we also spent a little bit of time talking about

33
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:32,031
this question of how to decide what to work on next.

34
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:35,001
So, how to prioritize how you spend your time

35
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,051
when you're developing a machine learning system.

36
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:41,004
So we talked about evaluation of learning algorithms,

37
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:44,022
evaluation metrics like  precision recall, F1 score

38
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:47,007
as well as practical aspects of evaluation

39
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,089
like the training, cross-validation and test sets.

40
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:52,031
And we also spent a lot of time talking about

41
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:55,074
debugging learning algorithms and making sure

42
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,021
the learning algorithm is working.

43
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:59,007
So we talked about diagnostics

44
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:01,099
like learning curves and also talked about things like

45
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:04,039
error analysis and ceiling analysis.

46
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,018
And so all of these were different tools for helping you to decide

47
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:10,034
what to do next and how to spend your valuable

48
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:12,058
time when you're developing a machine learning system.

49
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:17,066
And in addition to having the tools of machine learning at your disposal

50
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:20,022
so knowing the tools of machine learning like

51
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:22,012
supervised learning and unsupervised learning and so on,

52
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:26,001
I hope that you now not only have the tools,

53
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,045
but that you know how to apply these tools really well

54
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:32,065
to build powerful machine learning systems.

55
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:35,055
So, that's it.

56
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,064
Those were the topics of this class

57
00:02:37,064 --> 00:02:39,061
and if you worked all the way through this course

58
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,030
you should now consider yourself

59
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,051
an expert in machine learning.

60
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:46,087
As you know, machine learning is a technology

61
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:49,091
that's having huge impact on science, technology and industry.

62
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:53,036
And you're now well qualified to use these tools

63
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:55,035
of machine learning to great effect.

64
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,091
I hope that many of you in this class

65
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,076
will find ways to use machine learning

66
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:02,032
to build cool systems and cool applications

67
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,094
and cool products.

68
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:06,008
And I hope that you find ways

69
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,093
to use machine learning not only

70
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,076
to make <i>your</i> life better but maybe someday

71
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:14,074
to use it to make many other people's life better as well.

72
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:19,069
I also wanted to let you know that this class has been great fun for me to teach.

73
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,078
So, thank you for that.

74
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:23,080
And before wrapping up,

75
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,028
there's just one last thing I wanted to say.

76
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:28,095
Which is that: It was maybe not so long ago,

77
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:31,030
that I was a student myself.

78
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,071
And even today, you know, I still try to take different courses

79
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:36,090
when I have time to try to learn new things.

80
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,098
And so I know how time-consuming it is

81
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:42,027
to learn this stuff.

82
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:44,066
I know that you're probably a busy person

83
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:47,030
with many, many other things going on in your life.

84
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,083
And so the fact that you still found

85
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,043
the time or took the time to watch these videos

86
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:55,079
and, you know, many of these videos just went on

87
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,059
for hours, right?

88
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,006
And the fact many of you took the time

89
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,082
to go through the review questions

90
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:03,073
and that many of you took the time

91
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:06,024
to work through the programming exercises.

92
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:09,048
And these were long and complicate programming exercises.

93
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,083
I wanted to say thank you for that.

94
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:17,091
And I know that many of you have worked hard on this class

95
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:21,087
and that many of you have put a lot of time into this class,

96
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:25,039
that many of you have put a lot of yourselves into this class.

97
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:29,029
So I hope that you also got a lot of out this class.

98
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,034
And I wanted to say:

99
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:36,042
Thank you very much for having been a student in this class.
